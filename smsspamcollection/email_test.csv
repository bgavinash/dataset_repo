"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05orthern-ireland-police-powers-agreementBrown hails 'new chapter' in Northern Irelandas end to years of violencePromise of US investment follows 'momentous' agreement that seals power-sharing framework‚Ä¢ Henry McDonald Ireland correspondent‚Ä¢ quardian.co.uk Friday 5 February 2010 19.11 GMT‚Ä¢XBritish and Irish PMs endorse power-sharing deal Link to this videoNorthern Ireland's leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing ahistoric deal today which saved power sharing.Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart Brian Cowen flew into Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the dealwhich will create a Department of Justice gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves thepower-sharing executive from collapse.Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began 16 yearsago were inspirational."This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence yearsof talks weeks of stalemate."Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as "an important step to greater peace and prosperity for allcommunities on the island."Obama would also meet Cowen the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister SinnFein's Martin McGuinness in Washington on St Patrick's Day next month.Earlier Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a "shiningexample to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts".As a result of the deal she said: "The people of Northern Ireland are poised to build a thriving society on this strongerfoundation.Our economic envoy DecIan Kelly will continue to help Northern Ireland reap the dividends of peace including economicgrowth international investment and new opportunities. -In the near future Declan and I will host first minister Robinson and deputy first minister McGuinness in Washington."The Irish prime minister said the agreement reached "presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the lifeblood of the devolved institutions. The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangibleoutcomes that improve their lives."Referring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998 Gerry Adams the Sinn Fein president described today's agreement as"yet another good Friday." After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday the parties in the NorthernIreland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policingand justice powers which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April ‚Äî a key Sinn Fein demand throughout thesenegotiations.Under the agreement a six-member working group appointed by Robinson and McGuinness will formulate a frameworkfor handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission.The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems with the rights of marchers andresidents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks when the Northern Ireland executive will transferresponsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the group's proposals.An executive working group will be set up in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists to improve the way the power-sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrewsagreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish languagespeakers.Ian Paisley Jr the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUP's founder described the agreement as a "win forunionism".Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission which most unionists regard as biased infavour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had "no alternative except the imposition of joint authorityfrom London and Dublin".Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice Robinson said: "There are some who will playpolitics with this agreement but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormontthat our whole community identifies with and supports."Jim Allister the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP said he was "relishing the prospect" of a general election contestwith his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Sr's North Antrim constituency."In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondlytheir veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodiesare strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of paradingissues."Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post" he said.Shaun Woodward the Northern Ireland secretary said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined todestabilise the power-sharing government.He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now "two groups of people who were onceterrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge".But the Real IRA Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In thepast seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations acrossNorthern Ireland.Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policingand justice powers are transferred to Belfast.",0

"sbwhoeopMonday November 2 2009 6:23 PMHFYI: When you have a chance re: what Wm. Hague told you relevant undercurrent toEU debate. SidFrsOrn The TimesNovember 3 2009I suggest a night at the theatre Mr CameronA sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should beashamedDavid AaronovitchOn Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. Theplay was Our Class by the Polish playwright Tadeusz Slobodzianek.In a series of short "chapters" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.Like the village the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941 as the Germans replaced the Russians as theoccupiers almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to themassacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.Though the village is not named in the play it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10 1941. AsPoland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002 on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around thetown singing songs and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where one by one they were killed with knives axesand cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barnand locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from twokilometres away; no one survived.In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans butlocal Poles as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski then the Polish President apologised to the dead Jewsand their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne "in my own name and in the name of those Poles whose conscience isshattered by that crime".History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski who leads the Tory-backedgroup in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of21000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a bigpart of their political appeal.But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski the MEP for the Jedwabne area did not support the 2001 apology. Heopposed it vigorously associating himself with the "Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne". Among itsleading members were the local priest Edward Orlowski who ‚Äî asked by journalists whether he would be attending theceremony at which the President apologised ‚Äî said: "These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsibleso why should we apologiSe?"Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper Our Poland themurders ‚Äî which he abhorred ‚Äî were the work of a few outcasts and that he would only apologise if someone "from theJewish side" apologised for how "the Jews" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month MrKaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. "If you are asking the Polish nation to apologisefor the crime made in Jedwabne" he said "you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewishcommunists did in Eastern Poland."It is this argument that so incenses me‚Ä¢as it would anyone I think who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collectiveJewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.Mr Kaminski denied the apology denied the need for it equated the massacre to "Jewish actions" and allied himself withthose who denied the massacre altogether fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns ofmassacre denial: "it never happened it happened but was justified they did it to themselves they did it to us." MrKaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the lastfew weeks I think Mr Miliband is completely right ‚Äî it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: "Ishould apologise?"But more than that I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreignsecretary descended from Polish Jews should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician whovehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron hasgot right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.Now Tory columnists bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collectiveguilt and to attacking non-existent "smears" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.Why?It is true as embattled Conservatives have argued that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whosehistory is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping the EPP and in the socialist group. Butthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP forexample is the ruling free-market non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk ‚Äî almost certainly the party that MrCameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping the European Conservatives and Reformists by contrastis all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun bar one organisation ‚Äî the BritishConservatives.So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really and that MrKaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised hisEurophobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the "federalist" EPP and that the logicaloutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to thinkthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sectsthe Hannanites the Cashists and the Redwoodians?This is the kind of advice I loathe but I'll say it anyway.

"Senate Republicans Filibuster Fair Pay For WomenMatt FinkelsteinThe first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act which made it easier for women to seek justice forpay discrimination. At the time Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) Kay BaileyHutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats toovercome strong Republican opposition to the bill.But today all three Republican senators voted against a motion toproceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act a bill that "would furtherstrengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination." Themotion was defeated by a vote of 58-41 falling two votes short of the 60needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor.This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in theSenate. In 2008 the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it wasapproved by the House which passed the legislation again in 2009 withthe support of 10 Republicans.Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts makefor the same work but conservatives have invented a number ofludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example theHeritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurtwomen because businesses simply won't hire them if they are required topay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed thatwomen would receive better compensation if they just had more"education and training."",0
"PIR <preinesMonday August 16 2010 11:48 PMHuma Abedin; CDM; Jake Sullivan"minister in a skirt"http://mobile.nytimes.com/a rticle?a=644869North Korea Takes to Twitter and YouTube By CHOE SANG-HUN The New York Times August 17 2010SEOUL South Korea - North Korea has taken its propaganda war against South Korea and the United States to a newfrontier: YouTube and Twitter.In the last month North Korea has posted a series of video clips on YouTube brimming with satire and vitriol againstleaders in South Korea and the United States.In one clip it called Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a "minister in a skirt" and Secretary of Defense Robert M.Gates a "war maniac" while depicting the South Korean defense minister Kim Tae-young as a "servile dog" that likes tobe patted by "its American master."Such language used to be standard in North Korea's cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival is testimony to the increasedchill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.In the past week North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok or "our nation."Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named "uriminzokkiri." The Web sitewww.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea a propaganda agency inPyongyang.Lee Jong-joo a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul said "It is clear that these accounts carry the samepropaganda as the North's official news media but we have not been able to find out who operates them."The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korearesumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships killing 46sailors.North Korea which denies involvement has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter andYouTube with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outsideworld.)"YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda" said Paik Hak-soon an analyst at SjongInstitute. "But fundamentally it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash outdesperately in the face of mounting international pressure."During the cold war era South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years agoduring the brief era of its "sunshine policy" of engaging the North the South allowed its people access to North KoreanWeb sites. But today when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account agovernment warning against "illegal content" pops up.These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their ownopinions about the totalitarian North.But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinkingof the South Korean warship including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in theSouth.The Twitter account which provides links to the North Korean Web site had 928 followers as of Monday. But a fewYouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.In one such clip North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan the South Korean foreign minister who recently criticized "pro-North Korean youths" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections saying "If they like the North so muchthey should go and live under Kim Jong-il."The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a "pro-American flunky" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living "mopping the floor of thePentagon."Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the "American imperialists" because it was armedwith nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche or ideology of "self-reliance"; and because of a philosophicaltreatise written by Kim II-sung the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il who died in 1994."I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans" said Yoo Ho-yeolan expert on North Korea at Korea University here. "People watch this for fun not to be influenced."",0

"Did this with Sean. SidThe Political SceneConfounding FathersThe Tea Party's Cold War roots.by Sean Wilentz October 18 2010ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.A few months ago the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favoriteprops: a pipe clenched between his teeth. "I've got my pipe" he told his audience his speech slightly muddled by thestem "because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things." The theme of the day was "Restoring History" andBeck looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt began the lesson by peering at a stack ofhistory textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods produced by "malicious progressive intent." Progressives heexplained‚Äîliberals socialists Communists the entire spectrum of the left‚Äî"knew they had to separate us from ourhistory to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God." For the next hour Beck earnestly explained some of thehistory that "is being stolen from us": the depression of 1920 for example or how conservative economics saved thenation from the "near-depression" of 1946‚Äîcrises that progressives don't want you to know about. "You've been taughtone lie I think your whole life" he said.For the fractious Tea Party movement Beck‚Äîa former drive-time radio jockey a recovering alcoholic and a Mormonconvert‚Äîhas emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll released in July byDemocracy Corps showed that he is "the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters" seen not merelyas an entertainer like Rush Limbaugh but as an "educator." And in the past few months Beck has established his owninstitute of learning: the online for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102 which contends with"revisionists and secular progressives" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102 an attack on the activistfederal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103 a highly restrictive interpretation of rights federalism and thedivision of powers.During the "Restoring History" episode Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars where they can hear"lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find." The B.U. faculty consists of threemembers including one bona-fide academic James R. Stoner Jr. the chair of the political-science department atLouisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilderswhich the Web site calls "a national pro-family organization." Beck himself often acts as a professor a slightly jocular oneon his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures he offers explanations of current politics and history lessonsabout the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline he says began with the Progressive era of theearly twentieth century in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson when both the Federal Reserve System andthe graduated federal income tax came into existence. "Wilson" Beck told his radio audience in August "just despisedwhat America was."Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's FreedomSummit in Washington last September one activist told a reporter "The election between Teddy Roosevelt and WoodrowWilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill." And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group fromCape Fear North Carolina claimed on the group's Web site that "the very things you see happening in this country todaystarted with the Wilson Administration."At a Tax Day rally this past spring the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as "anunfettered new force of the middle class." And indeed calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson isaudacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement‚Äîor at least a new twist in the nation's long history ofconspiracy-mongering. In fact it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century agoespecially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration the late right-wing writer W.Cleon Skousen and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder Robert Welch. The political universe isof course very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of Americanhistory‚Äîwhich focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and CommunistChina‚Äîhas proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decadesinside the Republican Party have exploded anew‚Äîand why this time Party leaders have done virtually nothing tochallenge those ideas and a great deal to abet them.The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics for the right wing in particular. In the South racistviolence against civil-rights workers was constant deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in timedeliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials in support of what they called"massive resistance" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition whichclaimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered afearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when heresigned from the Army in 1961 after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wingpropaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator StromThurmond the Dixiecrat from South Carolina spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestlyliberal domestic programs "fall clearly within the category of socialism."The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by RobertWelch a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945 whom Welch called the first American casualty of theCold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall in 1954 many of McCarthy'sfollowers felt bereft of a voice and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties his society's membership wasestimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an "immense"domestic conspiracy declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tracttitled "The Politician" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as "a dedicated conscious agent of the Communistconspiracy" who had been serving the plot "all of his adult life." Late in 1961 after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion heaccused the Kennedy Administration of "helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do theopposite."Wherever he looked Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf oftotalitarianism. But within the United States he believed the subversion had actually begun years before the BolshevikRevolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism Welch described government as "always and inevitably anenemy of individual freedom." Consequently he charged the Progressive era which expanded the federal government'srole in curbing social and economic ills was a dire period in our history and Woodrow Wilson "more than any other oneman started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism."In the nineteen-sixties Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but "a tool of the totalconspiracy." This master conspiracy he said had forerunners in ancient Sparta and sprang fully to life in the eighteenthcentury in the "uniformly Satanic creed and program" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called "the Insiders" theconspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers governmentagencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service and nongovernmental organizations like theBilderberg Group the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century theyhad done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. "One broad avenue down which theseconspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation" Welch declared in 1966. "The very same collectivisttheories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of newand modern concepts."In the worst case Welch believed military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment anonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly he designed the Birch Society roughly if not explicitly on theMarxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate thepopulace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. "It isn't numbers we have to worry about" Welch wrote "but thecourage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough‚Äîthe same as the Communists do."The "Founder" himself would dictate the society's policies advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen andprofessionals and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. "It is the leadership that is mostdemanding most exacting of its followers" Welch observed "that achieves really dedicated support." Welch's groupbecame synonymous with right-wing extremism earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kellyto the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie made ahumorous run for the Presidency in 1964 organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.Still the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. Atransplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens Skousen was considered so radical in the earlynineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file notedthat "during the past year or so Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' whoare promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes." Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.from 1935 until 1951 much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs he claimedimplausibly gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that hehad served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University interrupted by a stint from1956 to 1960 as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious and after he raided a friendly cardgame attended by the city's right-wing mayor J. Bracken Lee he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen "a master of halftruths" and said that he ran the police department "like a Gestapo"; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on theMayor's lawn.After losing his police job Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society which Time described in 1961 as anexemplar of the far-right "ultras." Although he did not join the Birch Society Skousen worked with its American OpinionSpeakers' Bureau and in 1963 wrote a rousing tract titled "The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society" whichcondemned the society's critics for "promoting the official Communist Party line." (This was a tic of Skousen's; he laterdefended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called "The Communist Attack on theMormons.")All along Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In "The Naked Communist" a lengthy primerpublished in 1958 he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims writing that F.D.R.'s adviserHarry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium and that the Russians built the firstSputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel "The Manchurian Candidate"appeared Skousen announced that the Communists were creating "a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose mindscould be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters." A later book "The Naked Capitalist" decried theIvy League Establishment who through the Federal Reserve the Council on Foreign Relations and the RockefellerFoundation formed "the world's secret power structure." The conspiracy had begun Skousen wrote when reformers likethe wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson helped put into place theFederal Reserve and the graduated income tax.In 1971 Skousen organized another group the Freemen Institute which he later renamed the National Center forConstitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research the center's targetsincluded "the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the Environmental Protection Agency the FederalCommunication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting the federal government's change of the goldstandard in currency all subsidies to farmers all federal aid to education all federal social welfare foreign aid socialsecurity elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations."Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists including some on the right-wingfringe. In 1962 the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out because members felt that he had "goneoff the deep end." In 1971 a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of "inventing fantastic ideas andmaking inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary" and advancing doctrines that came "perilouslyclose" to Nazism. And in 1979 after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relationsand the Rockefeller family the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about hisorganizations.Skousen was undeterred. In 1981 he produced "The 5000 Year Leap" a treatise that assembles selective quotationsand groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible and thatthe framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison oftendescribed as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution who rejected state-established religions and like AlexanderHamilton proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. "The 5000 Year Leap" is not a fervidbook. Instead it is calmly ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils ofwhat Samuel Adams in 1768 called "the Utopian schemes of leveling" which Skousen equates with redistribution ofwealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. ThomasJefferson for example wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthywhich meant that "the farmer will see his government supported his children educated and the face of his country madea paradise by the contributions of the rich alone without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings."Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state asserting that "the Founders were not indulging in any idlegesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' "In reality the motto that came out of the ConstitutionalConvention was "E Pluribus Unum": out of many one. "In God We Trust" came much later; its use on coins was firstpermitted in 1864 and only in 1955 at the height of the Cold War did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.The following year President Eisenhower‚Äîwho Welch charged was a Communist agent‚Äîapproved "In God We Trust" asthe national motto.In 1982 Skousen published a follow-up work an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America" andprepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informativestudy of Beck "Common Nonsense" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987 after the CaliforniaBicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn fromlong-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon which characterized slave children as "pickaninnies" andsuggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove ofStanford inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them "a joke that no self-respecting scholar wouldthink is worth a warm pitcher of spit."By the time Skousen died in 2006 he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then in2009 Glenn Beck began touting his work: "The Naked Communist" "The Naked Capitalist" and especially "The 5000Year Leap" which he called "essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did." AfterBeck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list‚Äîand wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue‚Äîit shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009 it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousandcopies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots the United American Tea Party and other groups across the countryhave since organized study groups around it. "It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our FoundingFathers" a United American Tea Party video declares referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck isthe movement's teacher "The 5000 Year Leap" has become its primer with "The Making of America" as a kind of 102-level text.The popularity of Beck's broadcasts which now reach two million viewers each day has brought neo-Birchite ideas to anaudience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week Beck informs his audiencethat socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power and thatpatriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured "Comrade Updates" in which Beckdescribed perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the FederalReserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate unaccountable to the public); the Council on ForeignRelations (born of a "progressive idea" to manipulate the media in order to "let the masses know what should be done");and a historical procession of evildoers including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target WoodrowWilson. His sources on these matters quite apart from Skousen's books can be unreliable. On September 22nd amid adiatribe about House Beck cited a passage from "Secrets of the Federal Reserve" by Eustace Mullins. The bookcommissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerfulbankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year he produced a drawingof fasces‚Äîwhich he described anachronistically as "the Roman symbol of Fascism"‚Äîand then a picture of an oldMercury dime with fasces on the reverse side. "Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916‚ÄîWoodrow Wilson wasthe President" he said. "We've been on the road to Fascism for a while." Benito Mussolini of course didn't adopt theancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin the sculptorAdolph A. Weinman intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness and paired it with an olive branch to illustratethe desire for peace.Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt hewas not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term "lunatic fringe" to describe the extreme leftists of his dayand his concept of New Nationalism‚Äîin which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism partly by regulating bigbusiness‚Äîlooked back to Alexander Hamilton not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact in 1917 he sentAmerican troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home his reforms sought to break up monopoliesin order to restore competition among small companies. "If America is not to have free enterprise" Wilson declared "thenshe can have no freedom of any sort whatever."In 2007 Beck then the host of "Glenn Beck" on CNN's Headline News brought to his show a John Birch Societyspokesman named Sam Antonio who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada"and eventually all throughout the Americas." Beck told Antonio "When I was growing up the John Birch Society‚ÄîIthought they were a bunch of nuts." But now he said "you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me." Hisguest beamed. "Yes we at the John Birch Society are not nuts" Antonio said. "We are just exposing the truth that's beenout there for many many years." Since then the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcastsproudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck onCommunism in America as "the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of Americanhistory."Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson one of Skousen's close associates. Benson the Secretary of Agriculture underPresident Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints gained notoriety fora speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.Schlesinger Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers warned that "the Constitution will be endangered and hangas it were by a single thread" and praised the John Birch Society as "the most effective non-church organization in ourfight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism." Last June Beck aired a clip from another Benson speechintoning "Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming." The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for"getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John BirchSociety has been doing it for over 50 years."Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-sixties far right; he recently told the Times a bit disingenuously that he was "not involved with the Tea Party." Why thenhave the politics of Skousen Benson and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservativeRepublicans‚Äînot just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate SharronAngle? (Last month Angle gave a warm address to a "freedom conference" in Salt Lake City co-sponsored by the JohnBirch Society and Skousen's old group the National Center for Constitutional Studies praising her audience as"mainstream America" and patriots who had "heard the call.") The columnist Frank Rich among others has suggestedthat the election of a black President sowed "fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority inthe country." There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an "activist Justice" duringElena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by theminuscule New Black Panther Party. But "socialist" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the FederalReserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade federal-government bailouts and biggovernment generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past halfcentury. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties the far right was condemned by liberals as might be expected; inNovember 1961 President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those "discordant voices ofextremism" that "equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state the welfare state with socialism and socialism withCommunism." But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives who feared being perceived asparanoids and conspiracy-mongers.The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley Jr. the editorof National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of JosephMcCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government wasset by a socialist conspiracy and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced practicalconservatives their chance at national power. "By 1961" his biographer John B. Judis writes "Buckley was beginning toworry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly evenFascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted." In the next two decadeswith Buckley's support and counsel Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution thatsucceeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians Buckley had far more political influence than might beexpected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and theirfellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the BirchSociety went too far they would not attack the society publicly for fear of alienating both the Birchers and theconservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of"distorting reality" and failing to make "the crucial moral and political distinction" between Communists and liberals themagazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.By 1960 Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans andhe consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel in Palm Beach in January 1962 Buckley urgedGoldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing "kooks"lurked among the Birchers he insisted to Buckley that there were also some "nice guys" and that it would be injudiciousto attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in1964 and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: "Extremism in the defense of liberty is novice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."In the general election though Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson partly because Democratssucceeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan "In Your Heart You Know He'sRight" the Democrats shot back "In Your Guts You Know He's Nuts.") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he wasundeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967 he favored Richard Nixonamong a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics but considered Reagan who had only recentlybeen elected the governor of California too new to national politics. George Romney the governor of Michigan a wishy-washy moderate was obviously unsuitable to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller of New York.Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views especially on Communism and the Cold War; he hadestablished himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss a former officialat the State Department had spied for the Soviets. And promisingly Nixon was the front-runner. "It seems to me that weought to have a real chance of winning this year" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican NationalConvention. He served the campaign as an adviser and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare who had taken chargeof Nixon's media operations.But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some ofthe editors of National Review recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.nomination in 1960 didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whomWelch had called one of "the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene." As President in 1969Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidiousappeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972 even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took placelater that year with the antiwar Democratic candidate George McGovern voicing the country's anxieties over VietnamBuckley and the mainstream of what he called "responsible conservatism" returned to Nixon. The purist conservativeswere left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz a Republican congressman and a member of the John BirchSociety.Nixon won in a landslide and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. Theconservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And despite the embarrassment of Watergate in Nixon'ssecond term their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam and Buckley wrote revealed that the Democrats had "an indifferencetoward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom." Meanwhile the Buckley mainstream having readthe Birchers out of the conservative movement established itself as a permanent and growing force in the RepublicanParty and in national politics.In 1976 Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor Gerald Ford.After two terms as governor Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: ashrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Forddemonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion ofOrange County and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. Hispragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980 when he chose therelatively moderate George H. W. Bush his bitter foe during the primaries as his running mate. Though the decisiondismayed right-wing ideologues it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republicanmoderates and conservatives and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley whounderstood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.As President Reagan flattered the extremists‚Äîhe even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's FreemenInstitute‚Äîbut he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-stylegovernment and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. Heappointed moderates to positions of importance as when he made James Baker III Bush's close associate his first chiefof staff rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policyadviser Meese helped Reagan stack the federal b	
"nch with conservatives but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker andBaker's deputy the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver and his crusade as Attorney General to roll back civil-rightslegislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed as in the Iran-Contra scandal Reaganskillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And when he recognized in MikhailGorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat Reagan pushedforward ignoring the complaints that he had become in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase ""a useful idiot for Sovietpropaganda.""Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of thefederal tax code a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From thestandpoint of the mainstream right the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close tomatching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan his departure was the beginning of a long declineand it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure during the past twenty years that has allowed the current resurgence ofextremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies‚Äînot least when in the face of fiscalcalamity he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series ofattacks and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment personified by Senator Bob Dole tocheck some of the wildest charges the new Republican House majority after 1994 pushed by such ideologues as TomDeLay and Dick Armey had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton forcing an impeachment eventhough polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at firstto have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq forhis moderate position on immigration and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financialcollapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died during the 2008 primary season it seemed to symbolize the end of aconservative era. David Klinghoffer a former literary editor at National Review lamented that ""urbane visionaries andbuilders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears andresentments."" Conservatism Klinghoffer added ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism"" and isnow ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition but to little effect. The commentator David Frum a formerspeechwriter for George W. Bush lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about theRepublicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June thecongressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout lost avicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement Inglis was confronted on thecampaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank hadbought them at birth. ""And then of course"" he recalls ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and theBilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on FoxNews the night of the recent primaries he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware ChristineO'Donnell as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly criticism came fromSarah Palin Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing Republicans. Within days he was back on Fox proclaiming himself ""ahuge Tea Party fan"" endorsing O'Donnell and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would giveher its full backing.So far Rove an unlikely dissident is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward asBuckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside as have such former G.O.P.stalwarts as Charlie Crist in Florida and Mike Castle in Delaware both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections theRepublicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.Fifty years ago President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today Obama's WhiteHouse is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership on both the right and theleft the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may provetoo eccentric to prevail or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred ofgovernment. After the election mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""amassive almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already Rove and some leading Bushpolitical operatives including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie have been quietlysupplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But according to arecent poll more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party and it seems almost certain that aRepublican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in thecoming midterm elections.In 1906 early in the Progressive era the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage Mr. Dooley put the socialand political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution"" Dooley remarked. ""It'son'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now or even a year from now Americans may say thesame about the Tea Party. For the moment though it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing adegree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. Fordefenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics it is an alarming state of affairs. ‚Ä¢Read more http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz"",0

Sidhttp://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/15/europe-s-new-politics-of-fear.print.htmlEurope's New Politics of Fearby Denis MacShaneApril 16 2010There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities fortheir nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews Roma and gays. In theNetherlands Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim anti-Quran populism. InHungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on "Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entireworld." To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Itsleaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest'sParliament.Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term "radical populism" but toanyone with half a sense of European history the parallels with an older Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in thefirst half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear isproducing the same toxic politics.The Fidesz leader Viktor Orban was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a muchmore nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece‚Äîwhich is beinghelped so far by its euro-zone partners‚ÄîHungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to bepaid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government globalization and international capital was easy.But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right a Fidesz parliamentarian Oszkar Molnar says it's time to give"primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital Jewish capital."Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. TheCzech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader former premier Mirek Topolanek after he attacked the Jewishorigins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book The Populist RadicalRight in Poland the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: "Antisemitism is crucial to thePolish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for ageneral hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy." For the time being criticism of nationalist politics issuspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.But the record of his party activists‚Äîincluding Michal Kaminski Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament‚Äîis disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto PinochetKaminski uses ugly language about gays and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War IIwhen "Jews apologize for killing Poles."Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-right European People's Party which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in GermanyNicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France and ruling conservative parties in Sweden Italyand Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago the European Union heldVienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking "Jewishcapital" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.So radical populism‚Äîanti-Muslim in Western Europe anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe and anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant rhetoric everywhere‚Äîis no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election all the main parties are seeking toappease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens livingand working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe and no one knows how to deal with it.http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.htmlB6EitWhat a Tea Party Looks Like in EuropeMarine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing far-rightparty away from the fringe and redefining French politics inthe process.by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05 2010amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-ReduxMarine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)leads todayJean-Marie Le Pen the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right‚Äîthe man who for decades has played on the inchoatefears xenophobia knee-jerk racism and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters‚Äîhad just finished speakingto the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front partyfeasted on barbecue and apple pie they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth still the "provocateur" tauntingthe establishment the "toreador" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even theseyoungsters knew however that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. "She has the will the courage the temperamentnecessary and the competence" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. "It seems to me indisputable that she is ourcamp's best candidate for 2012."Tall blonde plain-spoken and thick-skinned Le Pen's youngest child at 42 is the heir apparent to his party. She'sexpected to win the contest for its leadership in January and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strongFrench nationalism relentless Euro-skepticism and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's afresh face a new look and with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates anew threat in French politics. In the eyes of many she's more effective‚Äîand thus more dangerous‚Äîthan her father.It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right andcast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left which beganafter his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government dividing their party. But inelections this past March Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. Sohe decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed takingcitizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or "Gypsies")booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls Sarkozy ironically did not. Hisabysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. "I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit" she says."My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father." The old man could be painted as acreature of the past a purveyor of old prejudices with a "sulfurous" reputation says Marine. Today however the Frontwants to bill itself as "neither left nor right." If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine'srival Bruno Gollnisch) well "tent pis" she says.Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime MinisterSilvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme‚Äîone of themthe former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-outbetween Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands the militantlyIslamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process oftrying to build a new coalition government.Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usualcaricature of "people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan" Marine Le Pen says and she still believes "the American rightis much more to the right than the National Front." She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiersmore effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligationto help its people. "We feel the state should have the means to intervene" she says. "We are very attached to publicservices A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French" including "access for all tothe same level of health care."Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks bycompeting factions on the right as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8 someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in thefamily's Paris apartment building. Miraculously no one was killed or seriously injured but the front of the building wasbrought down. The crime has never been solved. "The worst part wasn't just the attack it was that not a single politiciansent a word of condolence" she says. "It was difficult but it builds character it hardens you."That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidentialrace a year and a half from now he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.With Barbie Nadeau in Rome",0

"U ok with statement?Statement by the SecretaryThe Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His DelegationI join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland to the Kaczynski family and to thefamilies of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders fromacross the political spectrum men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation andwere leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the worldbut their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led President Kaczynski wasone of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracyagainst an oppressive regime a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a freepeople. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland but aroundthe world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow but they have always shown resilience and resolve inthe face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss.My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.",0

"<HTML><BODY>My dear friend <br><br>I am DR. Yetunde Bassey Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of NigeriaLagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. <br><br>On June 6 1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$25000000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. <br><br>Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an <br>automobile accident. <br><br>On further investigation I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. <br><br>This sum of US$25000000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. <br><br>According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. <br><br>Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old manÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8224ÔøΩ&#8364&#8482ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364 √¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩÔøΩ&#8222ÔøΩÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217√¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#353¬¨√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#382¬¢ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8224ÔøΩ&#8364&#8482ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#353¬¨ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩ ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩ≈°ÔøΩ&#8218¬¨ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩ≈æÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8224ÔøΩ&#8364&#8482ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364 √¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩÔøΩ&#8222ÔøΩÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩ≈°ÔøΩ&#8218¬¨ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364&#353ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩ ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8224ÔøΩ&#8364&#8482ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364&#353ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#353¬¨ÔøΩ&#8230¬°ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364&#353ÔøΩ&#8218¬¨ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#353¬¨ÔøΩ&#8230¬æÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364&#353ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8224ÔøΩ&#8364&#8482ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364 √¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩÔøΩ&#8222ÔøΩÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217√¢ÔøΩ&#8218ÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩ&#402¬¢√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#353¬¨√¢ÔøΩ&#8364&#382¬¢ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8217ÔøΩ&#8224ÔøΩ&#8364&#8482ÔøΩ&#402ÔøΩ&#8364&#353ÔøΩ&#8218¬¢ÔøΩ&#402!

"He released his hold. No need for the call.",0
"See below. Will send PIR comments shortly.To: CDMFr: CaitlinRe: Branch BookOverview:There are few surprises in this book. The "surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pickup on‚Äîthe two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosedinformation about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot ofthings that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring andmuch more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day and the next day" as My Lifeit does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact thatthere appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. FurthermoreWJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations that the number of direct WJCquotes was far fewer than I had expected.HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions withBranch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past with the exception of theGephardt comment and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC thoughtthat there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty muchaligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly or not surprisingly many of the problems discussed inthe book are those which face the current Administration‚ÄîMiddle East peace North Korea China etc...Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinionof the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example hisconnection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it) but there are some subjects that arestrikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising but it did notappear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic they just weren't addressed. Much like My Lifeone theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media especially long passagesabout NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting but youwould be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and hischronic fatigue with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.The book has quite a bit on Whitewater but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branchcould write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friendslater quashed who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch doesportray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacksWhitewater as a political hunt Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated fromWhitewater because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye suchas WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize."Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce Bennett and Kendall noother lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into in which WJC says part of the reasonhe didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time ifshe was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is avery small passage that could easily be missed but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing thisbefore. (This is addressed more fully below.)There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationshipwith Gore which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end and his contentious relationship withJanet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issuesare discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayedin a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period with ample mention of herrelationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC both pre- and post-impeachment.On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East Northern Ireland the BalkansChina Russia Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written aboutHaiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussionabout North Korea but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed inwhat seems to track mention of him in My Life which seems to have more detail and background than thisbook.In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that theUSSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in whereas Brach writes that the streetswould be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationshipbetween some such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin'sdrinking such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.One thing to note is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recordersgoing but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC'sGephardt comment.The following items are addressed in the memo:Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4WJC and Lewinsky's Silence 4HRC and Kissinger 4HRC and gay/lesbian 5Tension with Moynihan 5HRC as World Player 5Jesse Jackson 6Tension with Janet Reno 6Portrayal of Carter 7Relationship with Gore 8Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta HRC and Haiti Invasion ITAV co-author flapSubpoenas of CVC's Friends Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex Gore/HRC ticket WJC suggesting Rubin runfor Senate Trip to South Asia) 11Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime BillIn discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strainedinterpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Lifeonly mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages fromBranch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.‚û¢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department after fierce debate among the securityagencies indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to hispersonal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant‚Äîno bail lockdownsolitary confinement‚Äîeven though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets toChina or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored theirtreason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him morethan to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch 577]‚û¢ While Lee was indicted Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret unchargedand untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law withoutforeseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act any prosecutor should decide within thelegal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To hisdismay Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extremedetention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guiltypeople on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch 629]WJC and Lewinsky's SilenceBranch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it couldsend her to jail as she had denied it.‚û¢ "Also he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial ofthe affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship he said Starr couldhave turned him into a witness against Lewinsky betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties whileoriginal struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for hissteadfast denial nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account." [Branch 511]HRC and KissingerThe following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling EleanorRoosevelt.‚û¢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where hecomplained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued tosay "it was interesting in fact that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. Hisvisage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet announcing gladly that his worries were over becausethe Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh no Dr. Kissinger' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it'sdead. We'll keep fighting and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanchedspeechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last in Hillary's dream it registered thathis strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed'Hillary repeated lost in thought. 'You know I always get my revenge in dreams but never in real life.'[Branch 179]HRC and gay/lesbianWriting about a call with HRC from NYS Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very "exercised." WJC leftthe room. "He was subdued on his return. 'You know I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my lifethan Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative religious core formed before homosexual issueswere even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible and she was unsure what heat she could take.On the other hand personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch 551]Tension with MoynihanThere are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration withMoynihan. For example:> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia couldfight for themselves Branch writes "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just afreebie for him' snapped Clinton 'and he knows it.'" [p.140]> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihanfor aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]‚û¢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats and quoted anumber of them. Senator Moynihan for instance publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he wassure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihanskated blithely on the surface never produced results in Congress and could not withstand such scrutinyhimself for five minutes living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the PennsylvaniaAvenue Development Corporation." [Brach 182]‚û¢ "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regrettedhypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press "He doesn't understand...that he'sconceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the pressand said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption aboutClinton's motives." [Branch 299]HRC as World PlayerThere are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage both with WJC and on her own. Severalexamples follow:‚û¢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples‚ÄîtheClintons with the king and his wife Queen Noor‚Äîin the family dining room... Their agenda was adelicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The presidentsaid he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders waterdisputes travel barriers war grievances contested airspace sealed electrical grids and so on. Husseingave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch 170]> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995 "Her [HRC's] schedule was far moredemanding than ceremonial pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtroddenwomen." [Branch 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast witha superficial American press which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance inexotic Asia Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements forcitizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds toa NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying "she [HRC] played the traditional role of FirstLady as wife and mother...") [Branch 246]> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how shedepicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on therave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch 289]‚û¢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed fromurgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch 512-513]Jesse JacksonBranch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contactwith her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCsgratitude but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.‚û¢ "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke he calledChelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it wasanother story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened inAmerican politics. He did not know everything involved but he wanted to remind Chelsea how muchher parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all and if she needed to counselrage or pray he was always available." [Branch 497]Tension with Janet RenoThroughout the book from his nomination of her WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negativeopinion of Janet Reno.> "He complained about Janet Reno‚Äîmade it clear in fact that he felt alienated from his own attorneygeneral. If he removed her however the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy Jamie Gorelick who Clinton feared may share Reno'swholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become atarget...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick to start fresh it would touch off a firestorm of protestlike Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.That was not an option." [Branch 388-389]> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato andcontinuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her"desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit' the president said tersely. 'I didn'thire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'" [Branch398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements includingcoordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewaterbut that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since lettingmandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Renohad failed to defend the presidency itself‚Äînot Clinton personally but the institution‚Äîand by extensionthe entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered hermore na√Øve than upright and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch 399] He citesthat Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire secondterm.Portrayal of Jimmy CarterThere are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip toNorth Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to beon the front lines.North Korea:‚û¢ "On North Korea he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Goreand Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extremeisolation... Sure enough Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung who proposed to allowinspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official addinggratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White Houseseething but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of lettersand he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch162]Haiti:‚û¢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break withGore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission toHaiti to seek a truce with the junta Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). Hedidn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea Carter again Carter went tothe press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday and Carter invited to stayover at the White House called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the nextmorning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct the president said tersely was notright...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominentnegotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment toClinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president but Clintonfound this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference heallowed exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton Carter simply felt that he had earned the right tospeak his mind as an international statesman even about a mission he had accepted for the United Statesgovernment complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn butClinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident." [Branch 200-201]Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq‚û¢ "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent including former presidents Ford Reagan andBush. 'Dole will support me' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes but hedoesn't have much positive to say." [Branch 518]GoreFor the majority of the book there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few placeswhere he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end however describes theseemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.‚û¢ On page 92 Branch writes "No he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy asalleged but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security AdviserTony Lake boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher and disorganized Defense Secretary LesAspin." [Branch 92]‚û¢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and alsohaving Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as othernations were offended that Gore not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan toredeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January but WJC"pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.`Al' Clinton told him 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Goreerupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight said the president and were stillwrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC sawLewinsky. [Branch 316-317]‚û¢ On page 396-397 there is a scene which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore WJC et al working asa team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.‚û¢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a secondcriminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30000 per month. The conversation isabout a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.‚û¢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for hiskickoff events‚Äîonce from Geneva hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches weretechnical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himselffrom Clinton's personal flaws and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'First it was true. Second it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third Gore would bebadgered to death until he did. 'Al' Clinton told him 'if you thought it would help in the campaign Iwould let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'" [Branch 553-554]Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of hiscampaign. "On tape the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and toGore's pollster Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform‚Äîwhere he stood preciselyhow and where he would lead the country‚Äîbecause the Republicans would try to knock him offsubstance." [Branch 554]‚û¢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout but it was always framed as his fear of Gore notsucceeding him. For example "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smartexperience and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidentialcharacter over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff" but Clinton discountedthis liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also wasperceived to be too conventional a Democrat therefore lacking independence which called for Gore toemphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a broodingquality about him not worrisome or off-putting in itself but potentially damaging if his serious naturefailed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch 599]‚û¢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believeme said the president his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years hadit not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone whowould be a bright spot to run with perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey although he also goes intogreat detail about the virtues of Mikulski even though she would never get chosen. How much of thiswas WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch 599 618-19]‚û¢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be runningessentially for a third term said the president but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record wouldtarnish them with Clinton's character." [Branch 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debatethat had been heard before‚Äîthat Gore lacked style and a light touch.‚û¢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in oneof their stressful consultations by insisting that he Gore was a good politician elaborating that hemeant good on the policy and also good on the politics but admitted that he did not instinctively blendthe two. Gore said he had to think about it and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...Hehad the stuff to be a great president and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehowwithout seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch 623-624]‚û¢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsureat first about recording the details. At the outset it says "For his own part Gore was not angry nor didhe blame Clinton for his defeat but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around himdid." [Branch 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper‚Äîhe was best in theWhite House. Then he says "'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days'"Clinton told Gore 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your messagenow that we're being honest.'" [Branch 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that"Clinton's drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance thanClinton and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush and that he was an "unparalleled" vicepresident but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was"surreal."o Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raisingscandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personalintegrity but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore saidhe had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However he remembered telling the president thathe found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And thepresident was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations fortrouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe theensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election or unhinged. 'I thoughthe was in Neverland' he said." [Branch 643-644]o Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supportedClinton all through the impeachment publicly and privately while declaring himselfdisappointed. Yes said the president. He appreciated that. However persisted Gore Clinton didnot confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little tosay Clinton replied beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry had made mistake.He had misled the American people and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.Well he said this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a doubletake...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both ofthem angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significanthere?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayedhonesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..." [Branch644-45]Other‚û¢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life in Branch's book it has WJC askingMaggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. "Williams was shrewd discreetand efficient." [Branch 161]> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team'ssuggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against thepressure the lack of options and his sense of being trapped she said he was badly served by his foreignpolicy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion‚ÄîLakeBerger and Talbott‚Äîwere the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby RayInman as defense secretary." [Branch 189]> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator Barbara Feinman a friend of Quinn.HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draftchapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as aghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a femaleveterinarian of Socks' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch342-343]> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato as Chair of the Banking Committee hadsubpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records werethere. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed thesubpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch 362]‚û¢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky Branch says of Vernon Jordan "In ourglancing associations I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described aslighthearted or recreational." [Branch 495]> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers and Clinton's gut a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats theirbest chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down' he [WJC] said tut I don't think Alwould ever do it.'" [Branch 540]> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supportingHRC if she decided to run which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether thetwo events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win theNew York Senate seat Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."[Branch 557]‚û¢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh because "of hardintelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch 594] My Life discussesthe cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.DI 'Gephardt is an asshole" Hillary commented. The president pointing to my recorders advised gently that the tapes were on. Shewinced but shrugged with a smile. "Well he is" she insisted. In an awkward silence I backed up both machines to erase the firstlady's epithet." [Branch 263]",0

"So qatar and saudi?Yes or no to bahrain?",0
"Cc: Berger Samuel R.HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over thePakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more andwhile I have no silver bullet here are some further thoughts.-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target someAQ in Pakistan and that where they hold back it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and moreabout with whom AQ is imbedded..-- In particular they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they wantto cultivate in the event we "leave" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen thatbefore and will hedge their bets.-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we candisabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan it will be easier to get the Pakistanisto go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistandominated by the Taliban.-- Second I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted againstmilitary leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence wecan go after bank accounts travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers raisingthe stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Bluntermeasures of coercion like conditioning our assistance are more likely to be counterproductive. Giventhe level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people they would see this as another sharp swing ofthe U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult forthe Pakistani people to accept.-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Ofcourse the military's calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list thesedays but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting oureffort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time we can be asforward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment trainingwhatever material intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan --including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step we can do all that is possible todemonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..-- On the civilian side their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used canbe played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the useof these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to pressthem on AQ.-- Finally there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could takethat would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus onthreats to the East including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidencebuilding measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduceuncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy?To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants they couldsee such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.Sandy",0
"US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failedUlster police dealYes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast nextmonthDavid Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be "emboldened"to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if hefails to persuade the Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of USCongress members have demanded Cameron must "aggressively" encourage his partners to endorse the deal ina vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday."At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voiceabout their shared future" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.Without a unanimous vote they said the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message tothe people they represent and to the world."Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents willcontinue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge ofbringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there ispolitical stability."The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to theGuardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the DemocraticUnionists.A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the Britishgovernment has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state HillaryClinton wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubtsabout endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warnthe UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.A Tory source said: "David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing andcriminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details arefor the parties in the executive working as a four-party coalition to decide. We hope that between now andTuesday any outstanding issues can be solved."The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was thelargest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalistand Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement will meet hisparty's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assemblymembers account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote fromthe UUP seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it would destabilise many members ofthe DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.",0

"sbwhoeopSaturday January 9 2010 9:42 AMH: Succinct summary on NI situation at this moment. Details to follow later. SidJanuary 92010The First Lady her young lover and a scandalthat could hand power to Sinn FeinDavid McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences ofIris Robinson's infidelityThe mesmerising saga of the toyboy the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulfBelfast's frail political settlement last night.Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson head of the Northern Ireland government broke his silence toinsist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiryinto an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party the DemocraticUnionists (DUP) are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavyemphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in thecoming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Feinbecoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting thepeace process in jeopardy.Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife Iris who has exited from public life led to a day-long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family.Mr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactionswithout declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old "toyboy" lover to set up a business.Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel "to ask me any questions he or she wishes toask and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation".Insisting he had done nothing wrong Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting "smears and innuendo". Saying thathe did not rule out a defamation action he declared: "I am being tried in the court of public opinion."Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness who is Deputy First Minister said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seekingtalks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandalbroke but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive thestorm.Mr Robinson who has been First Minister for 18 months is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since hewas prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein.But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure fromalmost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing fromLondon to Belfast.His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents inthe Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to thefamily scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months.In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP foreast Belfast a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediatelyand stop drawing her salaries.These reflected the fact that while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival her behaviour is regardedas inexcusable.She had been a friend of Kirk McCambley's father Billy. Before he died he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. TheBBC programme Spotlight revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said shesuggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council where she is analderman.She is said to have obtained ¬£50000 from two property developers to be used to set up the business. She is also said tohave helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it wasinvestigating.The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinson's one-time political adviser Selwyn Blacka former Methodist minister who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson.Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice a hardline critic of MrRobinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed "with utter transparency and candour".Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinson's immediate resignation saying: "It is clear that IrisRobinson's continuing position as an MP Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all herpositions with immediate effect."He added: "It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party willstudy the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct ofthe First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against theFirst Minister."* Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future.But he said: "It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing thepolitical process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas."And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deepfreeze even some may wish to unpick they would be extremely irresponsible foolish and would be playing very verydangerous games."Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunityto clear his name.But he went on: "I'm very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening he is First Minister and the business ofdevolution the business of the Executive must go on."I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continuesand that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution."

"You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may beridiculous or objectionable though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world but barring him for his political opinionshas created a needless PR disaster not least for the US as he is after all a US citizen and a very prominent oneinternationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred forhis political views after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone needs yesyes like a hole in the head and bone stupid but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of the story. Thisincident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future. This is adownward slope bad news for everyone involved. S14 16 2010 11:01 pmChomsky Barred From West Bank by IsraelBy ROBERT MACKEYNoam Chomsky an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel was denied entry into the WestBank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver alecture.Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:No reason was initially given for the decision but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridgeborder crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.Chomsky who is on a speaking tour in the region was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank onMonday.A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and "officials weretrying to get clearance from the Israeli military which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter."In a television interview from Amman Jordan after he was rebuffed Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English "the facts werecompletely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding." He explained that he was interrogated forseveral hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-old scholar added:I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation ‚Äî hewas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One wasthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say ‚Äî which puts them into the category of I supposeevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking aninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities as I have done many times in the pastbut not this time.Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at thePalestinian university in Ramallah.The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza which ended in January 2009 andhas criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times.In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003 Mr. Chomsky said "I objected to thefounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would objectto the United States as a Christian state." When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel saying"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew" he replied:It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque.

"Dear friend I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons Joseph and Basher out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan Cote d'ivoire where my family and I settled while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. I have deposited the sum Fourteen Million United State Dollars (US$1400000000.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate your interest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf so that I can introduce you to my son (Joseph) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as advise by your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this upcoming project demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence which I repose in you.In conclusion if you want to assist us my son (Joseph) shall divulge to you all briefs regarding this project tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact informationthat is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address. Yours sincerely Mrs. Mariam M.

"Dear Friend.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry forme because I believe everyone will die someday.My name is MR.HARRY HAKEEM a merchant in Dubai in theU.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a fewmonths to live according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well as Inever really cared for anyone(not even myself)but mybusiness. Though I am very rich I was nevergenerous I was always hostile to people and onlyfocused on my business as that was the only thing Icared for. But now I regret all this as I now knowthat there is more to life than just wanting to haveor make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to cometo this world I would live my life a different wayfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has calledme I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended familymembers as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soulso I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in the U.A.EAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health hasdeteriorated so badly I cannot do this myselfanymore. I once asked members of my family to close oneof my accounts and distribute the money which I havethere to charity organization in Bulgaria andPakistan they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is thehuge cash deposit of TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS$12000000that I have with a finance/Security Companyabroad. I will want you to help me collect this depositand dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 25% for you and for your time if you want to help me to collect this Funds and also invest this money.N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THELAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY HEDOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERYUNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOURSUCCESS IN JESUS NAME.",1

"charged to court for a multibillion dollar arms deal fraud which was politically motivated by his enemies as her husband was the chairman of parliament in South Africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political party. We had pleaded guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges but were later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank accounts in my bank and abroad being frozen.Now as a matter of urgency we need your assistance in the remittance of the discovered funds abroad. The funds are currently deposited with a bank in South Africa which I will disclose to you upon my receipt of your favorable response and consent in this deal.The amount is US$22.5 Million United States Dollars which was deposited by Mr. Tony Yengeni before his arrest. At the moment the account is on Dormancy because no one has been operating the said account since his arrest. All the account details and documents where also brought to me by his wife.

The Central ElectionCommission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within tendays; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko who has been silent publiclyplans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts but they will not change theresult. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite streetprotests.Our recommendation isEU Ambassadors in Kievhave recommended the same approach to Brussels but want to revisit it if there is no progressby Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today with praise for the conduct of elections butstopped short of congratulating him on his victory.Following certification of the election Tymoshenko is likely to appeal within the legal five-dayperiod.

" "MY GOOD WILL" I greet you in the name of God Almighty. I am former Mrs. Saleh Galal now I am Mrs. Mary Saleh Galal a widow to Late Dr. Mohamed Galal. I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in LONDON ATTACK BOMB. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So I now decided to divide part of this wealth by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America Canada Africa Europe and Asian Countries. This mission who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it I am willing to donate the sum of $7300000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country and i have map out $1700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work. Please note that this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore I forward to you immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped. Lastly I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God one's life is vanity upon vanity. I await your reply.Mrs. Saleh Galal ",1
"Crowley Philip J <CrowleyPJ@state.gov>RELEASE IN PARTB6Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob Eric Mike Melanne Lissa and me. This can be usedfor the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will askthe Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the ForeignPress Center early this week which will attract a good number of Asian journalists and make sure the question is askedso we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJBEGIN TEXTQuestions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the UnitedNations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statementshe said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries including Sri Lanka.Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficultconflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) stretching into thisdecade the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape andsexual violence in Sri Lanka particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This wasthe basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time in the most recent phase of the conflict from 2006 to 2009though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings disappearances and mistreatment ofdetainees we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war as they clearly have inother conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of themilitary conflict Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on thepromotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250000displaced persons who are still confined in camps and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. TheUnited States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.",0

" Dear Sir Dearest Valued FriendIt is with deep sense of honor and respect that I humbly make this appeal to you with the understanding that any fact/s or opinion/s expressed in this letter are given in confidence and solely for your personal information and use. If it does not interest you discard the mail but if it makes sense to you I open my arms wide to do business with you.I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise;Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation with co-operation of two other top officials we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41500000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general and foreign direct investment in particular are the real engines for sustainable economic development for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them so as to continue to enjoy close relationship and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself. I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70% and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.

"Dear Sir/Madam My name is Mr. Jenif Davix I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48223000. 00 (Forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet investigation I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person knows about this account. I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account  no beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which I will provide to you if you are interested therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account. I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should also provide me with your direct phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction. At the conclussion of this transaction your share will be 25% of the total transfer sum 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 20 Million to your account. I will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will have the remaining balance of USD28223 Million transferred to your account only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side. Have a nice day as I entrust this transfer into your hands. Finaly reply to this e-Mail address bellow if you are willing to do this business with me. <jenifdavix@timemail.com> Best RegardsMr. Jenif Davix.FAX:874-76-2533361TEL:874-76-2533360",1

"PLEASE WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE.You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally. I am Mr Arbu Mpula the son of Dr.Henry Mpula who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.I got your contact through South African Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) in Johannesburg and I decided to solicit for your assistance. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death he had taken me to Johannesburg- South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 23.Million(Twenty three Million United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he Foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.The money was deposited in a metal box and declared as a personal effects for the use of some of his friends who were to arrive for the world conference on racism scheduled to hold in South Africa from fromr 1st march 2003.This money was given to my father by President.Robert Mugabe himself for investment in South Africa when they were in good terms. The dispute between my father and the President arose when the President introduced a new land reform-act which adversely affected the rich white farmers and so black farmers as well. My father was vehemently opposed to the "modus operandis"adopted by the government and publicly oppose it. This brought him in direct conflict with the president. To achieve his purpose the president used war veterans to plunder loot and occupy all farms belonging to the white farmers and their black sympathizers. More than Fifty Farmers has lost their lives so far. Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and United States of America have voiced there condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously Supported Mugabe's new land act it is against this background that I and my family who are currently Residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest Son of my Father I am saddled with the responsibility Of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money Could be transferred without the knowledge of my Government who are tactically freezing our family Wealth and South Africa's government seems to be Playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of Encountering the same experience in future since both Countries have almost the same political history.so the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for an "assylum". As a businessperson that I entrusted my Future and that of my family into his hands I must Let you know that this transaction is 100% risk Free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance we are offering You 20% of the total sum 75% for me and my family While 5% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incurs during this transaction. We wish to invest our Money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally will demand for assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country. If this proposal is acceptable by you please confirm your interest via the above telephone or you reply through email.

Op-Ed ContributorGermany in Need of a DreamBy JOHN KORNBLUMHas Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is nolonger the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the FrauleinGermania of 2010 as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany myBlackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:Germany has changed very little but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945 but trauma remains a defining issue for Germansociety. Sixty five years later Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability respectability andpeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solelywithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did notremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany sometimes over the opposition ofothers ‚Äî including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushedthem with determination.Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a commoncurrency but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark for decades the European monetary standard. The eurostability pact now the object of so much controversy with Greece was the result. After 1990 the E.U.'s eastwardexpansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.Slowly and without fanfare Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the wayGermany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused byGermany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded inpursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his but it almost always left leadership to others.A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. "Europe" in the institutional sense has becomeincreasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the GermanConstitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance toGreece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German TeaParty?Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the "motor of Europe." Ms. Merkel'sunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many it signified the decline of Germanwillingness to "salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot but they happen to be the only ones whocan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption thatcharacterizes many E.U. programs.Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them the question iswhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so surethat its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to aglobalized world.And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not thatGermany is dangerous; even worse that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many otherswhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning toburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense ofcommon purpose the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselvesoften tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200000 of them were waiting to hear when theyrallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to "Dare to Hope" which is thecharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. Americaseems busy elsewhere.The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building ademocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting tohaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big forGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works the United States will bejoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space within which modern democratic values will harnessmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will beassured.European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream andthe United States is too busy to try we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up itsside of the bargain Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised ‚Äî the audacity of hope.John Kornblum senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin served as the U.S. ambassador toGermany from 1997 to 2001.",0

"FOR THE LOVE OF HUMANITYDear FriendReply to:naybet@web-mail.com.arYour first reaction to this mail will be total rejection scare and may be disbelief owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days. But this mail comes from a devastated sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone dies someday.My name is Naybet Trabelsi a merchant in Dubaiin the U.A.E.I worked with Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources for eight years as a contractorI have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatmentI am very worried as the doctors have informed me that its terminal.I don't know how much time I have left on earth hence this mail to you.I have not particularly lived my life well as I never really cared for anyone but mybusiness. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul hence I decided to give alms to charityorganizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.EAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be content with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $1800000000 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.Reply to:naybet@web-mail.com.arNaybet Trabelsi>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>FREE Email?

Christian Eich Who died alongside with his entire family on Monday 31 July 2000 in a plane crash in paris.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learntthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and my colleagues decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after seven years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your designated bank account you must apply first to the bank as a relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application that we will send to you so we will like you to send to us your private telephone  fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the moneywill be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply we will send to you by fax or email the text of the application . we will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

The Chinesecompany will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project according to an agreement signed Sunday in LausanneSwitzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that coversa 90 percent stake in the project.A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still Tehran's motivation for releasing thisinformation in English at this time is worth considering.The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below and I found three Chinese-language sourceswith corroborating reports (nothing in English from China though):http://business.sohu.com/20090929267094148.shtmlhttp://money.163.com/09/0929/14/5KCSKN5F002524SO.htmlhttp://finance.sina.com.cn/world/gjjj/20090929/18566807524.shtmlJackiePress TVIran China sign a major oilfield dealMon 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMTChina National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for thedevelopment of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield.The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project according to an agreement signed Sunday inLausanne Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO)that covers a 90 percent stake in the project.CNPC which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield now holds a 70 percent share of the projectwith NICO holding 20 percent and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260000 barrels of crude oil per day and its development will costaround $2.5 billion.The field along the Iraqi border holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil one of the world'slargest finds in the last 30 years.Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.The deal is couched in buy-back terms in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC afterdevelopment and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries led by the US have sanctioned Iranover its peaceful nuclear program.Jacqueline NewmyerPresident Long Term Strategy Group12 Eliot St. Cambridge MA 02138617-661-1620 (ph)617-661-1626 (fax)www.ltstrategy.com",0

"At bottom is the People op-ed. I just checked and ironically the figure comes from Melanne's testimony during an SFRChearing where she stated: ""The scale and enormity of the violence directed at women [in the DRCI can scarcely beadequately described. Some 1100 rapes are being reported each month with an average of 36 women and girls rapedevery day.". Triple checking the origins.Hillary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'Originally posted Friday August 21 2009 12:30 PM EDTSecretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week but last week the formerFirst Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton'sthoughts on a trade issue ("My husband is not the secretary of state I am" she retorted) the emotional heart of hertour was also her most dangerous stop ‚Äî in Goma inside the war zone in eastern Congo where she tearfully met rapevictims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -and what she will do about it.What I Saw in GomaBy Hillary Rodham ClintonIn 11 days of travel across Africa I saw humanity at its worst ‚Äî and at its best. In Goma last week I saw both.The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma aprovincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violentconflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informalmilitias these men women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safehaven.Now they live in tents one next to the other row after row some clinging to life others hanging on to whateverglimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of theirhomes possessions families and worst of all their dignity.Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale as sexual and gender-based violence hasbecome a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1100 rapes are reported each month with anaverage of 36 women and girls raped every day.I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two oftheir children and shot them in the front yard before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Thenthey beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managedto get her to the hospital ‚Äî 85 kilometers away.I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them andabet them. They are crimes against humanity.These acts don't just harm a single individual or a single family or village or group. They shred the fabric that weaves ustogether as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen healthcare workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the woundedin Goma I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who havebeen raped often by gangs and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children or walk or work.Caregivers like Lyn Lusi who founded Heal Africa in Goma and Dr. Denis Mukwege who founded the Panzi hospital inBukavu represent humanity at its best.The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding toprevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical carecounseling economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officersto protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women andfront-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. Andwe will deploy a team of civilian experts medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assistsurvivors of sexual violence.While I was in the DRC I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that theperpetrators of these crimes no matter who they are must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly importantwhen they are in positions of authority including members of the Congolese military who have been allowed to committhese crimes with impunity.Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma and it will notend with my departure.We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in theeastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring anend to this conflict.There is an old Congolese proverb that says "No matter how long the night the day is sure to come." The day mustcome when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again to tend their fields play with their children andcollect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They arestrong and resilient. They could if given the opportunity drive economic and social progress that would make theircountry both peaceful and prosperous.Working together we will banish sexual violence into the dark past where it belongs and help the Congolese peopleseize the opportunities of a new day.",0

She also was her country's head of delegation to Beijing. She was foreign minister at the time and made a strongstatement about gender equality and the transformative power of microcredit.

"Goodday to you My name is Victoria McKnight and I am an artist. I live in LondonEngland with my two kids four cats one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full house. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about 23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few college art courses.Most of my work is done in either pencil or air brush mixed with color pencils. I have recently added designing and creating art work on the computer.I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work featured on trading cardsprints and in magazines. I have sold ingalleries and to private collectors from all around the world.I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes to selling my art works to International Clientsthey are always offering to pay with an International POSTAL MONEY ORDERwhich is difficult for me to cash here in ENGLAND.

"<DIV><DIV><DIV>Hello my dear</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>I wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.My name is Mr.PATRICK AGOLO a lawyer based in Lagos State of Nigeria.As a lawyer I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades) to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives 3-months ago in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. Prior to their death this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately they died childless with no knownrelatives or next of kin.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>The issue at stake for which I am writing you now is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated.<BR>Soon after the burial of the deceased I had promptly notified the bankwhich is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>Incidentally as I said before the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;As a whiteman you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person.</DIV><DIV>I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours.</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30% while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.</DIV><DIV>Pls. keep these disclosures confidential.<BR>Thank you.<BR></DIV><DIV>Sincerely yours<BR>Barrister PATRICK AGOLO(ESQ)</DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV></DIV><p>__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?

"Possibility of Senate Run Nurtured and Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03 2010 New York TimesA few weeks ago Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band the powerful counselor toformer President Bill Clinton.Mr. Ford the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street wanted to discuss a potential challenge toSenator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary a possibility he had flirted with for weeks.But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across thecountry it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. "It's not the right thing to do" he saidaccording to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had beentold that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr.Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand.Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate which he disclosed on Tuesday came after he reached out to dozens ofdonors advocates and political leaders. In private conversations the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms.Gillibrand would be a brutal fight dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New Yorkresident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights.A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead he feared become mired indiscussions of "who got there first and who meant it the most" on social issues he told an associate. That might allow aRepublican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee.What seemed to weigh on him interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealedwas not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee but rather the reality that there werefew easy constituencies for him to grab on to outside of Wall Street where he has worked since moving here in 2006.Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.As he hopscotched from city to city charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography signs of trouble for Mr. Fordemerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats and his $2 million-a-year job atMerrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist.What seemed like an improbable even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations many dating back a yearamong Mr. Ford 39 and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City Washington and Los Angeles.Over dinner last July at the Post House a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side Richard Plepler a co-president ofHBO urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. "I think you should give this serious thought" he said ofthe Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would.After the dinner Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen a top Democratic pollster to bounce the ideaoff him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued and as he studied public polls became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot atreaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand.Over the next few months Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connectedexecutives frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf the head of the United Statesinvestment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner thefounder of Quadrangle the private equity firm all of whom are big Democratic donors.Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford who is also a political analyst on NBC that money would not be a problem. "You can raise themoney" he told him in December.Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand a relentless campaigner had beaten him to the punch."She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up" was the message that Marc Lasry a billionaire hedge fund managerconveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation.As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City especially upstate he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to beshallow and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse Stephanie Miner told him that residents therewere "scared and desperate" about the economy and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in hercity.But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late Januarythe head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez held a luncheon for Mr. Ford and invited locallawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session Marty Markowitz the borough president pointed toseveral up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in NewYork politics than Mr. Ford."With all due respect" he asked Mr. Ford "why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?"Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrandwould be harder than it seemed.Ruben Diaz Jr. the Bronx borough president told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office "It'sdifficult to make a strong case against her here." Ms. Gillibrand he explained had just secured $4 million worth offederal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack hisrelatively conservative voting record but those he spoke with said he was taken aback by the depth of the anger heencountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage.After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress Mr. Ford vehementlypushed back saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest.It did not. "He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up" a friend said.One of Mr. Ford's top advisers Bradley Tusk the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-electionarranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally Kelli Conlin the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr.Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin however started the meeting byquizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements.Did he realize she asked that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman'shealth is in danger?Far from conciliatory Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cutoff financing for abortions. "You gave her a pass" he said. Before leaving Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose torun he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: "We can never support you if you takethese positions." Mr. Ford "looked shocked" a person in the room said.His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of theStonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan he was greeted by signs that read "Liar!" and "Gohome snake oil Harry" a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it inCongress.A few days later the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in giving hisadvisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions ofhis record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable the data showed but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. "It was nota slam dunk at all" said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data.Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote a tall order but notinconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week Gov. David A. Paterson andRepresentative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was inseeming disarray just when he needed them to be organized and unified.By Sunday he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife Emily and his father former Representative HaroldFord Sr. He began to call friends the next evening leaving many of them brief messages."I'm not going to run this time" he said in one message. "Thank you for your support."",0

""Dear Friend It is my prayers that in any time in your life that you need help God himself will come to your aid. Before continuing I do like to inform you that this transaction is a risk free. It is completely risk free. The money inquestion I want to transfer into your bank account is my inheritance from my late father. It is a legally acquired money so there is nothing wrong about it. BecauseBefore the death of my father in the united kingdom He sincerely called me on his bed side and told me that he had a sum of Eight million Three hundred thousand United state Dollars ($8300000 US DOLLARS) kept in a local bank here in the united kingdom.He also used his name to Deposit the moneyand me as his only daughter as next of kin/heir.i am the only survival of the family as my mum died 3 years before my dad of child birth. Like I told you in my mail I am alone now. I want to transfer the money into your bank account after which I shall travel to meet with you in your country so that we can invest the money in lucrative businesses. I am only 21 years now and I do not have any experience of investment. I am hoping on you to make the investment. Last week I went to the bank here where the money was deposited to inform them that I want them to release the money to me. The bank people told me that their was an agreement with my late father during the time of deposit that the money will not be given or release to me until I am at least 24 years of age. Now that I am not up to 24 years the bank said that I have to appoint another person who will act as my guardian so that they will release and transfer the money directly to the person. The bank said that the person that I will appoint must be a least 24 years or above. This is the reason why I have contacted you urgently to help me receive the money. The second reason is that my father who was poisoned by his own family before his death told me to transfer the money to a bank account of a person of my choice abroad and leave this country immediately and also the crises here is getting worse and never subsides. I do not know any one that I can contact this is reason why I have requested you to help me. My dear It is true that we do not know each other before now I believe that we can work with one another and become a very reliable partners. I know for sure that both of us will handle this transaction to a mutual benefit. once I hear and concluded with you I shall give you the contact of the bank here so that you can contact the bank as my guardian and request for urgent transfer of this fund to your account. The bank is already aware that I should appoint some one and they have been waiting for me to give them the name of the person. The bank will work directly with you and will release the money directly to you. Once the money is released the bank will transfer the money into any account that you will donate. This means that you will need to provide a bank account where the money will be transferred into. it does not matter if there is money in the account or not. All the bank needs is a valid account that can receive the money when it is transferred. Once the money is transferred into the account that you shall donate you shall send me some money back here so that I can arrange for my traveling documents . I hope to meet with you one week from the time that the money have been transferred into your bank account. Concerning the reason why I choosed you I will like to tell you how it happened. I do not know who I was going to appoint as my guardian. Now the time is running and I am getting more confused. I starting asking God for directives on that. On day I decided that I was going to look for people contacts and profile and select any one that my mind told me to pick. I went to an internet center here in the united kingdom were I present live and started searching on the internet. I got a lot of contact but I copied only three and took it home. When I got home I kept the names and was praying on it so that God will direct me. I was afraid but a last I had this aasuring in my spirit that God will never let me down as an orphan. On the last day I was led by my spirit to take you among the three names. I did not waste time but contacted you the next day. I trust you but I trust God the more because he will never fail me nor leave me. From you mail too I am sure you are the right person for me. I am compelled to even trust someone that I do not know because I do not have any choice. I hope that this mail have explained so well and if you need to know anymore thing do not hesitate to ask me so that I can answer. When I receive your next reply. I will leave you here and until I hear from you I remain.You can reply me at teihi919@yahoo.es In God's loving arms.

"My name is Dr. John Moore and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feels quite safe dealing with you in this important business. Though this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However this correspondence is unofficial and private and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANKHERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEANORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER a program leader. Until his death The Late Prime Minister Mr. Rafik Hariri has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world as a matter of fact he has the sum of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables. The families do not know about this deposit. I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim thismoney with legal claims to the account Holder I need your full cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money. Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1 1944- February 14 2005) married to Nazek Audi Hariri was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 202004.

I have not particularlylived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone(not evenmyself)but my business. Though I am very rich I was never generous I wasalways hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was theonly thing I cared for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life thanjust wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe whenGod gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life adifferent way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me I havewilled and given most of my property and assets to my immediate andextended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided togive alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charityorganizations in the U.A.E Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health hasdeteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once askedmembers of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the moneywhich I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan theyrefused and kept the money to themselves.

"Dear FriendI am Director of Civic registration and finance Nigeria National Orientation Agency (NNOA) Federal Ministry of Information. I must start this email by acknowledging the wisdom in choosing to reveal my 26years AMBITION since the National Identity Card project was kicked off some 26years ago by a bill passed into law by the national assembly for the registration and identification of every Nigerian above the age of 18years.During our final verification exercise we discovered an excess allocation to our agency to the tune of Fourteen Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollar and we intend to keep this money for our personal use by fronting you as one of the foreign contractors due for payment. This sum (US$14.3Million) will be paid into your account as your contractual entitlement.The good news is that precisely 1st of April 2004 26years after the government has started distributing the national identity card. The reason am writing you this mail is that the presidency federal republic of Nigeria have approved allocation for payment due to all contractor (Foreign and Local) to the agency and this gives us opportunity to transfer this over invoiced sum to you who we shall present as a foreign contractor. We are handicapped in the circumstances as the Civil service code of conduct does not allow us to operate foreign accounts hence your importance in the whole transaction. Therefore we want to utilize this opportunity as a lot of foreign contractors will be paid in this quarter of the year 2004 to transfer the fund out of the country.Please do not disregard this mail and for avoidance of doubt you can verify the National Identity card projectby visiting our website as posted by Nigeria business information in 2003 when the registration started. But do not disclose my identity or the actual nature of this transaction as I am still a serving officer in the ministry. http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/id-card180203.htmIn other to present you/your Company as the beneficiary of the sum of US$14.3M. For this purpose we will incorporate your company and register you as a contractor with the Nigerian National Orientation Agency (NNOA). We will also by virtue of our official positions secure for your company the necessary backup documentation that will facilitate the release/transfer of the fund into your account. These documents of course will be destroyed within 10-14 working days at the successful completion of the transfer. We want to assure you that your help will not in any way bring your company name into disrepute.",1

But within a few months of being sworn in the President and his top aides were sittingdown with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reformpossible.Over the following months pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens oftimes to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda inexchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceuticalindustry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to pushtheir case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts disclosure forms including lobbying reports and FederalElection Commission records White House visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S:::in. MaxBaucus releases yoiun:tarily--is atestament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.In the 2008 campaign Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's healthcare system but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uoksies. Among these were several that targeted thepharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providingMedicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These weren'tjust promises Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-)150.)Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans schooled in the monied Washington culture chief of staffRahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser Clinton administration officialinvestment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign managerB6and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for theirunparalleled legislative abilities.Because of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process members of Congress alsoplayed key roles. Early on the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committeechairman Max Bpuf.-4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House andPhRMA.Central to this effort was PhRMA president CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin a longtime Democratic member ofCongress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching partiesTauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescriptiondrug access to Medicare recipients one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare wouldnot be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not beallowed. A few months after the bill passed Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking ajob helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.Tauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of2008 simply titled ".Biliy." It featured the candidate sleeves rolled up talking to a salon of gasping Americans about theways of Washington. "The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiatewith drug companies. And you know what the chairman of the committee who pushed the law through went to work forthe pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year." The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that "BarackObama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money" while the candidate continues his lecture"Imagine that. That's an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know I don't want to learn how toplay the game better I want to put an end to the game playing."Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.Over the course of 2009 the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside fromPhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number oflobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were formeremployees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers includingtwo former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics drug makers coptr.ibu‚ñ†ed sums to ....:ongressionalecii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from January to the end of October (4thquarter numbers are still beingtotaled) industry political action committees employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million.Those contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in anyelection cycle going back to 1990 the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving thatDemocrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill and the new President's intention to reform America'shealth care system the new tilt was perhaps not surprising.On March 5 the White House a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table andsee what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin president CEO and top lobbyist forPhRMA Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen lgnani Tom Donohue of theChamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White Housemeeting Tauzin 31)12.7.a_f;=‚ñ†.:4_1.7...-1 Ci\IF:..lc touting health care reform and promising to work closely with the Obamaadministration. In the interview he touted it as an "optimistic plan" acknowledging that the industry did have a fewproblems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Spme were duri?07rognndtd by this apparent change ofheart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.On April 15 Jim Messina and Jon Selib chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus convened ameeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized laborand health care groups including PhRMA. At the meeting the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promotereform efforts Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care that would be almost entftelv funoed pj.PhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went toWhite House Senior Advisor David AKPD which owed Axelrod $2 million.In the next month CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at leastfour times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House one critical to its strategy to promote healthcare reform. On May 11 PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost ..-v_itting_measures to the White House thatwould save they claimed upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the StateDining Room flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the pressand on the White House Web site.The next day Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the healthcare reform process calling for the government to finally "fix" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elementsof the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that theycould ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House:The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives including Tauzin and industryCEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day the publicly availableschedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committeechairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.In a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to newsre_gorts Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June2 were able to win the lower figure.The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the "donut hole" in Medicareprescription drug coverage. The "donut hole" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescriptiondrug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2700 spentand does not pick back up again until $6154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percentcoverage for drugs within the coverage gap however would not completely close the "donut hole."In Baucus' press release Tauzin is quoted as saying "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and working together wecan make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today." This "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity also extended to thepharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices throughMedicare negotiations re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grandstatement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the WhiteHouse and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.Baucus proceeded with a_pian c.c)r.ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House.These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley Mike Enzi andOlympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which werereliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet theWhite House's announced iltuouet reces¬ß dee&rie for passing health care reform.Soon after PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met withRehm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for thismeeting). In August The Huffirytorj. !Dosi'.--; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting thatoutlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicareprescription drug negotiations drug re-importation and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part Dand Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.***While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee other congressional committees continued to mark-up theirown versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce thefinal product. In the House of Representatives the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gottenthe White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating powerand speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by thecommittee these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreedto by the White House Baucus and PhRMA.The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA which included all of theCEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go publicwith the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4 the Los Ancg‚Ä¢3les‚Ä¢Firrief--: inan exclusive report featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed andthat as Tauzin put it "The White House blessed it." Tom Hamburger wrote in the article "For his part Tauzin said he hadnot only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining but also a separate promise not topursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe."The White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim stating "The president encouraged this approach ... Hewanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform."Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva chairman of the Progressive Caucus asked "Are industry groupsgoing to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?"***On September 7 Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed$80 billion. Five days later the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in anadvertising blitz in support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending "...would be a follow-up to the deal thatdrug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House." On September 16 Baucus released the full text of hisles.j.islation to the public. tThe White House PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendmenttargeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida which has one of the largestMedicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to pushfor further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the "donut hole" completely.Nelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue or from PhRMA's perspective increase theircost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA to Baucus to the White House and to thepharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted withRepublicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carper's Delaware is home toAstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb all of which lobbied for the $80billion cap.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill with the cap in place on November 19. Debate began on Dec.3 and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced anamendment that would allow for drug re-importation but as the date for voting drew near the Federal Drug Administration(FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: "...as currentlywritten the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition there aresignificant safety concerns." Dorgan's amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support ofreimportation switching to "no" votes.On Christmas Eve the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.***New Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform billhad been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator TedKennedy in Massachusetts on January 19 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be thesenator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s Democrats put the brakes on their agenda particularlyhealth care reform.in the end the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform would be left up in the air. After spending $100million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for thepharmaceutical industry the legislative process had flat-lined. In February the board of PhRMA split over the deal cut byTauzin pushedjauzin to_res..i.s. his .post.In an interview with Diane Sawvqf. President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform"[The health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents but also amongstsupporters that we just don't know what's going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of backroom deals."",0

More so we are handicapped in the circumstances as the SouthAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operateoffshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to wardsthe successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall bothbenefits from. This US$18.3M arose from the balance of the total contractvalue for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria Johannesburg andSoweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it wasawarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president MRNelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm which wethe officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract costhave been fully paid to the original contractor. I have the authority ofmy partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us(which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sumwill be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall providefor the funds to be transferred into 70% for us and 5% for taxation andmiscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe on your partprovided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also yourarea of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution ofthis transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that youwill not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistancewe shall invest in property management/real estate business in yourcountry. And that is why we offered you 25% of the total amount not justto receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred toyour account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life Ihave been a civil servant.",1
"Dear SirThis contact is being made to you out of the increase need. Ostensibly this may some what aroused some kind of surprise and suspicion both by its source method or channel of transmission. It may also be seen unjustifiable based on rules of certain values but certain concerns and considerations has increased quite immeasurably and contemptuously in me hence my approach. I am DR BENNARD ABAH a member of the movement for Democratic Change in ZIMBABWE? My party is opposed to the ZANU-PF of the incumbent president ROBERT MUGBE. I went into a partnership with a white farmer and businessman in ZIMBABWE and as we progressed in business I bought his ideas and philosophy which made me join the movement for democratic change which is dominated by the white (of which my colleague is a top member). We control the greater portion of the white-dominated farms in ZIMBABWE and we are major shareholder in major companies in ZIMBABWE. The MUGABE government and his political associate are not tolerant to the activities of the movement for democratic change and he is using indirect guerrilla war tactics to oppress the members. ZIMBABWE war veterans invaded our farms and confiscated some of our assets and held us hostage. I manage to escape from their brutality but my business partner died in the struggle. He left a message that I should sell off our assets including the farms estates and the companies ensuring that his family relocates overseas and also to invest the money properly bearing in mind that the next step of the guerrillas will be to confiscate those remaining assets. I have successfully sold off the remaining portion of our estates tobacco farms and companies after which I managed with the help of the immigration officer to sneak into JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA with the money and my colleague's families. In fact we are seeking refuge in SOUTH AFRICA at this moment. The total sum in our possession at hand is the sum USD36 MILLION realized from auction sales of the estates tobacco farms and companies. The money is secured in a security company. We are being highly restricted by the South African Authorities in opening up bank accounts here thereby adding more pain to the existing sorrows; a good study has also shown that South African as a base for our asylum is not the bests of a choice. Evidences available show that South African is a nation in crisis a fractured and bitterly divided nation since after apartheids rule not suitable for good and strong investments. It is an irony that the level of crimes corruptions mistrusts mischief in the country is seemed to have for years endangered the economic development and has scared foreigner's investors away from investing in the country. I wish to link up some one with strong characters who I can trust and enter into an understanding with and some one with good knowledge of investment to administer funds into business. This should be done under none-disclosure and none circumvention framework. I have lots of drawbacks in the South African environment as issues in the country does not seem to go far enough to guarantee hope trust in investment. Please if I can have your confidence trust and understanding in this matter I will be glad to have you contact me with this email address:tendand@webmail.co.za Please this is not a case of money laundering of illicit funds. I have 2 options for you; the 1st is that you could choose to have 25% of money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you could as well go into a joint business partnership with me for proper investment of the fund in any best choice of your wish once the money is transferred into yourOverseas account.

"FROM THE DESK OF.. DR AMIRI BABOBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGERFOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK OF AFRICA(B.O.A)OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASODear FriendI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department BANKOF AFRICA .In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$25M US dollars (Twenty five Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2002 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next if kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leavingnobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the money will be released to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I propose that 30% of this money will be for you as my foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me. Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by e-mail a text of the application which you'll fill in and send to the bank's email address.. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for further clearifications.Yours faithfully.

"Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the nextphase of free association aid. FYI only the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response totheir proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning therelationship. (This hasn't affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the UnitedStates delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C. and expanded upon in subsequent communications.While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specificelements of the Palau proposal and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues the Palaudelegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did notseriously respond as required by the Compact to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palau'scomprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency.In light of the foregoing the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiongthe next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact.

"Greetings!May I take the liberty to introduce myself; I am Mr. Lin Geng. I am astaff and a member Audit Committee of a reputable Bank in China. I amcontacting you concerning a customer here and an investment placed underour Care sometime ago. I would respectfully request that you keep thecontents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of thisinformation. I contacted you independently of our investigation and nobodyelse is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you withcertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2000 thesubject matter came to our parent bank to engage in business discussionswith our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had afinancial portfolio in United States Dollars which he wished to have usturn over (invest) on his behalf. We spun the money around variousopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months ofoperation the accrued profit was very impressive. He later directed thatI liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a security firm.In October last year we were contacted by the security firm informing usof the Issues concerning that particular portfolio. This was a surprisegiven the fact that I personally managed the said funds yet I cannotunderstand the inactivity of the deposit. We made several unsuccessfulefforts to locate him. The Internal Investigations department of the bankof china was invited and they went into action and later informed that aperson who suited is description was found dead in Cannes South of France.His body was later identified and cause of death was confirmed. Aninvestigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about thesituation and also to come forward to claim his estate was launched.Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usuallyin most cases leave wills in our care in this case; he died intestate.In line with banking policies for account holders who have passed away weinstituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who shouldhave right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past monthsbeen unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our privateinvestigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. Myofficial capacity dictates that I supervise the investigation and concludemaking me the only person with a full picture of what the prevailingsituation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of thedeposit. According to practice the firm will by the end of this financialquarter broadcast a request for statements of claim to BOC failing toreceive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back toBOC. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but Iwant you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the bankingworld who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards forthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. Youshould have begun by now to put together the general direction of what Ipropose. This deposit is very huge with the details in my possession andwill only be released on my clarification. This bank has spent greatamounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigatedfor months and have found no familyMy proposal; is to place you in the position of the next of kin and have",1

The initial cost of the contract was pegged at US$60 million but after the feasibility study that was done while submitting my report to the office of the presidency for final approval we deliberately inflated the cost to an excess amount of US$ 20..5 million making the cost to be US$ 80.5 million.Right now the gist of contacting you is we are constrained to claim the fund due to certain lawsenacted by the government guiding civil service code of conduct Bureau which prohibits top civilservants working under Government establishment from operating offshore or foreign Account and this situation has kept us in a fix to openly come forward to claim the outstanding balance of US$20.5 million hence after series of private meetings we decided to make contactin order to get a reliable foreign partner whom we will forward his or her credentials to claim the fund based on mutual trust and agreement.In a nutshell we need your assistance and support to claim this fund so that at the later time convenient for us we will come over to your country after the funds have been transferred to meet you and collect our own percentage while you will keep the rest as yours.For your support and total dedication to realize the objectives of this operation you shall be entitled to 20% of the sum total 5% for misslaneous expense like telephone bill while 75% of the fund belongs to the three officials involved in the deal.Note you are vividly assured that you will not be subjected to any kind of risk for your support and involvement in this venture hence we have piloted a good strategy to ensure the operations goes smoothly of which we have targeted two weeks duration to accomplished our Aim.Kindly treat this matter Absolutely confidential because the officials involved are still in serviceand some of us intend to resign our appointment immediately after the transaction is finalized.I look forward to hearing positively from you while further details will be given as soon as I get your response  forward your telephone number fax numberand mailing address for through which further correspondence will be made as soon as i receive your reply .Best RegardsMr GEROGE AMACHREENB:- FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MY PERSON AND COMPANY I WILL ADVISE YOU LODGE ON TO MY COMPANY WEBSITE ABOVE",1

"PVerveerSaturday December 18 2010 1:22 PMchild marriage defeatThe defeat of the Child Marriage bill I fear is a harbinger of what's to come. After passing the Senate unanimously therewas every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is trulydistressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.On another note i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari thewhole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US.z..L ;; ;‚Ä¢=r-i e forc; ePosted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS'Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening thatwould have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad by invoking concerns aboutthe legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road thatthe ¬∞barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the nextCongressional session.Non-governmental organizations women's rights advocates and. lawmakers from both parties spent yearsdeveloping and lobbying for the "International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010" whichthe House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted for it and only 166voted against because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under "suspension of the rules." Thisprocedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill but carries the disadvantage ofrequiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.; Even still supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.failed. After all it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. includingAppropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS) Foreign Relations Committee memberRoger ‚ÄòVick-er (P.-MS) and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).if passed the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance "to prevent the incidence of childmarriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational health economic social and legalempowerment of girls and women." It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-yearstrategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annualevaluation of countries' human rights practices.So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6"she objected to the Post of the bill which would be Si.08 million over five years and criticized it for notproviding an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The 'said the bill would authorize $1o8 million but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to2015.Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheetgDF.) organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementationprocedures that gave the legislation teeth. "Without such activities the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actualimplementation. And without implementation of a strategy the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact"they wrote.Regardless the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come outagainst it. But about one hour before the vote every Republican House office received a message on the billfrom GOP leadership known as a Whip Alert saying that leadership Nyould vote "no" on the bill and encouraging allRepublicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters."There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts tocombat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws" the alert read.The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already; prohibited by what's known as the almeneÃÄ" which has been boiler plate language in appropriationsbills since 1973.Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stuntconsidering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not havean impact on the abortion issue.Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeatthe forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning."Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum(D-MN)] that would have moved money no new money would have moved money so that societies that arecoercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced into marriageat the age of 12 and 13" LaTourette said. "Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn't work peoplehad to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a Republican. I'm glad we beat their butt in theelection but there comes a time when enough is enough."But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill including Aaron Schoch(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen willcontrol the Foreign Affairs committee.The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) who was incensed when the bill failedin the House.-The action on the House floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.and girls around the world" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. "These.voung girls enslaved in marriage will bebrutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continuethis barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill."For the NGO and women's advocacy community the implications of this defeat extend much further than just thisbill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence AgainstWomen Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the "Mexico City Policy" which wouldprevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion."Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor we're going to see a debatelike the one we just saw" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. "It's hard to imagine how anydevelopment bills are going to pass in this environment."The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who promised to elevatethe issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. Shehas said that forced child marriage is "a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights" and that "theDepartment of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse".State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behindthe scenes. But at the eleventh hour when the going got tough the bill's supporters said that the administration wasnowhere to be found. In October the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child SoldiersPrevention Act another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between theages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Councilreproductive and child health estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if currenttrends continue.!One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?‚Ä¢ :) isthe Pakistani militasy's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.Pakistan ‚Ä¢ a major offensive involving approximately go000 troops against extremists in SouthWaziristan in October 2009 and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other borderareas. However the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan where insurgentgroups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.Pakistan's envoy in Washington Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan willengage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan including the ‚Ä¢Hartgani network (no relation) but only when there issufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort and not until they are confident that themission can be completed effectively."Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as amodern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country" Haqqani said in an exclusiveinterview with The Cable. "But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success."Haqqani said that the Pakistani army which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan inwhich domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process is simply not in aposition to expand its war on the extremists now."Right now it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged indealing with flood relief work" he said. "We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the countryand those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period."He also noted that "there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements"and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on atimeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones."Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makesdecisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities" Haqqani said.In several discussions with other Pakistani officials an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position onattacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is beingunrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border which have existed for decades. "There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and donetheir way" another Pakistani government official said.; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much ofthe blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions suchas speeding up building up of Afghan army establishing a real process toward reconciliation and providingPakistan the means for large scale operations" the official said.The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support itswar against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterizeas the slow arrival of these funds which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's severe problems."It's very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan" one Pakistani official said.In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday President Obama was diplomatic whendiscussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan."Increasingly the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to allour countries especially Pakistan. We've welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We willcontinue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists" said Obama. "Nevertheless progress has notcome fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their bordersmust be dealt with."Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that therewas more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. andNATO-led mission in Afghanistan."Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan they fear our abandonment" she said. "Theircalculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategicpartnership."The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. "The bottom line is that Pakistan is a countrywhere we have little influence little access and little credibility" one of Obama's aides to‚ñ†..-:) The New York Times.The administration's official line therefore is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to itsclaim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time."We would like them to move tomorrow we would like them to take out these people tomorrow" the new U.S.Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. "But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity oftheir military and when they are able we are convinced they will move in."But for many in Washington the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North.Waziristan represents a strategic choice and is not just a result of the military's operational limitations. Butwhatever Pakistan's reasons the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet itstimelines for making progress in Afghanistan."Pakistan meanwhile iS hedging its bets supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and HaosianiNetwork that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw"Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security. 'The insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan are one ofthe two Achilles heels in the NATO strategy."‚Äò0 tt"Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PSTIn a rare instance of bipartisanship the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday honoring thelife and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.The resolution C was sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign OpsSubcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwomanIleana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) Howard Berman (D-CA) and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is "a concurrentresolution honoring the exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing thesignificant contributions he has made to United States national security humanitarian causes and peacefulresolutions of international conflict.""The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday December 13th is a great loss for the American people" Loweysaid in a statement. "One of our nation's most talented diplomats Richard Holbrooke possessed a fiercedetermination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security diplomatic and developmentinterests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe at the United Nations and most recentlyin Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker diplomat writer scholarmanager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our time."Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as "one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century" andsaid that "his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us all inhis debt."After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state peace negotiator in the BalkansU.S. ambassador to the U.N. and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Ros-Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies."In New York at the UN [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in UNspending to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States and to improve the standing of Israel in thatmultinational body" she said. "Sadly those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the need forfundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the Congress canonly hope to have such a tenacious principled partner in the future."You are subscribed to email updates from Email delivery Dowered by GoogleTo stop receiving these emaIls you may .r...hs‚ñ†-.;Inc. 20 West Kinzie Chicago IL USA 60610",0

"Dear FriendAs you read this I don't want you to feel sorry forme because I believe everyone will die someday.My name is Dada Abua 74years old merchantin theU.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancerwhich was discovered very late due to my laxity incaring for my health. It has defiled all forms ofmedicine and right now I have only about a few monthsto live according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well as Inever really cared for anyone not even myself but mybusiness. Though I am very rich I was never generousI was always hostile to people and only focus on mybusiness as that was the only thing I cared for. Butnow I regret all this as I now know that there is moreto life than just wanting to have or make all themoney in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come tothis world I would live my life a different way fromhow I have lived it. Now that God has called me Ihave willed and given most of my properties and assetsto my immediate and extended family members and aswell as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul andso I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in theU.A.EAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health hasdeteriorated so badly I cannot do this my self anymore. I once asked members of my family to close oneof my accounts and distribute the money which I havethere to charity organization in Bulgaria andPakistan they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore  asthey seem not to be contempted with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows about otherthan my distant relative who is presently in theNetherlands is the huge cash deposit of 8 milliondollars that I have with a security company inAmsterdam.I will want you to help me collect this deposit withthe assistance of my relative and dispatch it to",1

"HelloI wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations when we cannot help it or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS. WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm. I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the governmentif nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will and lay claim to the legacy of $7million which my deceased client bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now I alone know about his will as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victimsas this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter as there are documents to back it up. This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling. ",1

"Below is the article I mentioned:U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast ArmsWashington Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. ConferenceBy JONATHAN WEISMAN JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIAThe U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons as the U.S. seeksto prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington‚Äîcriticized by somefor its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal‚Äîwill equitably address weapons proliferation across the region asIran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significantprogress has been made on Mideast peace.The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which is held every five years is expected to begin with abang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who has condemned the West for its refusalto disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies havebeen pressing for new tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program."The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. Theofficial highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emergedfrom a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty but no action on the zone has been takensince.Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclearweapons-free zone and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egyptwould resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel the Arab states Iran andTurkey."We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before" said the seniorU.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.U.S. officials stressed however that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances inArab-Israeli peace talks."We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate which would be unlikelyunless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted" said Ellen Tauscher undersecretary of state for armscontrol and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other membersof the Nonaligned Movement.The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-securityconference in Washington in March due to such concerns.An Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons but that"it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all thecountries in the region."The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building newJewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days thatties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on tracknext week though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administrationwants to see.Egypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament "as soon as possible." It also called for Israel's nuclear program to beplaced under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won'tbe accepted U.S. officials said.The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release "all information available to them on the nature andscope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel."U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task ofcalling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone."They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections" said Henry Sokolski executive director of the Non-ProliferationEducation Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.Daryl Kimball executive director of the Arms Control Association an advocacy group said the U.S. acceptance of aspecial envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal first floated by Russia waspart of the U.S. offer.The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for thisconference for nearly a year.The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn't escape inspections andsanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could helpnations develop peaceful nuclear power.Write to Jonathan Weisman at jonathan.weisman@wsj.com Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Joe Lauria atnewseditor@wsj.com",0

"cheugpuixx7@yahoo.com.hk Dear FriendLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client "Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed depositfor 18 calendarmonths with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to himeven during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still noresponse came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of hisbankdeposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one willever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong KongGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessarydocument that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to anaccount that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.Pleaseendeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me 30% for you.Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below;",1
"Deutsche ÔøΩbersetzung unten.----------------------------- SULE OKETAYO EAGLE BANK PLC suleoketayo@alexandria.cc Dear Sir/Madam I am Sule Oketayo the head of the Treasury Department of Foreign Operations Eagle Bank PLC of Nigeria. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13500000.00 (Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 1998 in an auto crash. This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relativesext of kin of the deceased up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money.I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing. The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money if unclaimed after five years of maturity will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management. I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable.

" Dear Sir/Madam I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland. I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field). All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased. The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud AlkharjÔøΩs property for her and her son. You must be asking where I got your mail address it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running if you are interested to assist us all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing you as the only beneficiary. The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not permanently resident in Switzerland. For your assistance we made up of I 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are concerned as they will be going to the surviving wife and child. If you are okay with the above explanations you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine after which we will make more information available to you on how we will proceed. I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com. We await your timely response. Best Regards DR PETER CLAPTON",1

"Greetings I am Barr Charles Brown a Canadian attorney based in Manchester United Kingdom and the personal attorney to Late Mr. Mark Michelle a French National. Late Mr. Mark Michelle until his untimely death was a private oil consultant/contractor with the British Petroleum Company herein after shall be referred to as my client. On 23rd December 2003 my client and his wife with their three children were involved in a ghastly auto crash; all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries with his countrys' embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives. After several unsuccessful attempts I decided to personally contact you with this business partnership proposal. The deceased had a deposit valued presently at Eighteen Million United states dollars and the company has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or beneficiary. Having been unsuccessful in locating any of my late client relatives for over two (2) years now. I am now seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin/beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. I have worked out modalities for achieving my aim of appointing a next of kin as well as transferring the money abroad for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 35% for you and we shall collectively donate 10% to the charity homes course while 5% will be set aside for any incurable expenses both local and international. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions. Also the paperwork will include proper certificate that the fund being transferred is from non-criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer with no risk involved. The transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problem. All I need is your trust and confidence. As soon as I hear from you I shall provide you with further clarification that you may need to know. Best wishes Mr. Charles Brown. ",1

"FROM:MR NABA MOHAMMEDBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGERAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B)OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.Dear Sir/Madam (PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL)I am NABA MOHAMMED the MANAGER in charge of BILL AND EXCHANGE section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B) Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso in West Africa.With due respect and egard I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on November 2001 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before my discovery to this development.Although personally I keep this information secret within myself to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the Bonafide next of kin to the deceased get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker)we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills while 65% will be for me. Please you have been adviced to keep "top secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your email.Yours faithfullyMr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZINFERDINAND AVENUE OUAGADOUGOUBURKINA-FASO._________________________________________________________________Ten : profite de ton Messenger en illimitÔøΩ sur ton mobile ! http://mobile.live.fr/messenger/ten/",1

"Here's a basic summary:It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy and on highlighting that it is the nuclearweapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that USnonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselvesand that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointedattacks on the USG from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us"the most hated" in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have usednuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 "proposals" most of which were previewedin Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten withnuclear weapons disarming all US nuclear bases support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC.The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.",0
"DEAR FRIENDI am Mr.Joseph Poon Executive Director Of Operations of the Hang Seng BankLtdSai Wan Ho Branch171 Shaukiwan Road Hong Kong.An Iraqi named Hamadi Hashem a business man made a numbered fixed depositof (346736899.68 HKD) for 18 calendar months; this is valued to Forty Fourmillion Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Uponmaturity several notices was sent to him even during the warfour years ago(2003). Again after the war another notification was sent and still noresponse came from him. We later found out that Hamadi Hashem and his familyhad been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home atMukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.After furtherinvestigation it was also discovered that Hamadi Hashem didnot declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperworkof his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at myoffice that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So Forty Fourmillion Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bankand no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is thataccording to the laws of my country at the expiration five years six monthsthe funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.My proposal I am prepared to place you as the next of kin in a position toinstruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as the closest",1

However I got your contact through the International web directory.Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued USD14 000000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only) that belongs to one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash.During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER who died along with his wife and his two sons and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development.The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six years it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is only an outsider from the bank that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund. In order to avert this negative development I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER. Please go through the website below to confirm this storywww.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants we can not do it on our own or with close friends because that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund even an empty account can also serve for this purpose.On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 25% as gratification for your assisting us while 5%will be set aside to take care of expenses on our both sides that may arise during the time of transfer and also for telephone bills and the remaining 70% will be for me and my partners.What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in my possession all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation. Please bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish. Best Regards.Dan Patrick.",1

"Jake when you can I think I speak for the group when I say that we'd like and After Action Report on last night's datewith Dr. Senkler - especially curious if your plan to transition from the initial expanded group to a more restrictedbilateral meeting worked as planned.And while I'm writing here is about the most straightforward piece about HRC ever written in the NY Times - with thisclassic line: "...a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit blowing out loud funnynoises whenever she said something striking."Clinton Ends Africa Tour Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York TimesPublished: August 15 2009SANTA MARIA Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation 11-day trip Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintonwrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent."I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed" Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde."I have seen the joy and energy Africans have evidenced not just by the boogieing but by the hard work andperseverance" she said referring to a recent comment from her husband former President Bill Clinton that she knewhow to "boogie" with African dancers."And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself" she added presumably referring to Congo where Mrs. Clintonmet victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucialallies on the continent like Nigeria and South Africa and sending a message of "tough love" as she called it to nationslike Kenya and Congo.Over all she said the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner not simply as a patronor dispenser of aid. In exchange she said African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa even after she gets back to Washington closely monitoring the issues sheaddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches andenormous tourist hotels as an example of what good leadership can do."This is possible" she said. "You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility."Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some ofAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya she pushed for the government toprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa the big issue was Zimbabwe and how theSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.In Angola the theme was good governing practices and oil a strategic concern of the United States given the manyinroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo Mrs. Clinton waspassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic."The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer forthat conflict" said John Prendergast a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. "Her commitment toaddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to theusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.""Now" he added "comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectationsengendered by her visit."In Nigeria Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia she praised the country's president Ellen JohnsonSirleaf the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.The Liberian visit had a special warmth almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19thcentury by freed American slaves and the country's flag the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberantwelcome there and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit blowing out loudfunny noises whenever she said something striking."I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go" she said.In Cape Verde Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once she said she had a cheat sheet on a countrythat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500000 people and has escaped theturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found inCanctIn or the Bahamas.Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde "a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa."On Friday just as she had at every stop she started her speech by saying "I bring you greetings from President Obama."She called him a "son of Africa" and said that under the Obama administration the United States was determined tohelp Africa reach its promise.###",0

My office is saddled with the responsibility of contract award screening categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as feasibility studies for selected projects and supervisig the project consultants involved. The DPR is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid for the first Fiscal Quarter of 2005. The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the DPR deliberately over -invoiced the contract value of the various contracts awarded. In the course of disbursements this department has been able to accumulate the sum of Thirteen Million Seven Hundred and Thirty One Thousand U.S Dollars as the over-invoiced sum. This money is currently in a suspense account of the DPR account with the Debt Reconciliation Committee (DRC). We now seek to process the transfer of this fund officially as contract payment to you as a foreign contractor who will be fronting for us as the beneficiary of the fund. In this way we can facilitate these funds into your nominated account for possible investment abroad.

In the process thesum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)was found lying in the parastatal suspense accountafter the foreign contractors had been paid theirrightful dues for executing the said contracts.We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount betransferred (for our own use) into a bank accountprovided by a foreign partner because we aregovernment workers and the Code of Conduct does notallow us to operate foreign accounts.However we have succeeded in transferring some ofthis money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollarsonly) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (NorthAfrica) but the provider of the account in MOROCCO isup to some mischief and refuses to comply to theearlier mutual agreement by insisting that the totalamount be paid into his nominated bank account beforedisbursement will take effect. If for a meagre sum ofUS$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are notcompensated is it when the balance of US$22M(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that wewill be sure of our full compensation? Of course thisabuse of trust and inhumanity calls for soberreflection and search for absolute trust.Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance thatthe remaining amount of US$22M can be speedilyprocessed and fully remitted into your nominated bankaccount. On successful remittance of the fund intoyour account you will be compensated with 30% of theamount for your assistance and services.So far much have been said and due to our sensitivepositions we cannot afford a slip in this transactionneither can we give out identity as regards ourrespective offices but whereby cordial relationshipis established smooth operations commences you willbe furnished with details of all you deserves to know.I am at your disposition to entertain any questionfrom you with respect to this transaction so contactme immediately through my e:mail for furtherinformation on the requirements and procedure for thistransaction.Please treat with the strictest confidentiality andutmost urgency.Yours faithfullyMR FRED OBI.",1

"Cc:Samuel BergerSaturday August 28 2010 5:30 PMHSamuel BergerPrinciples_Design_Working Draft.pdf; Principles_Design_Working Draft.pdfHRC: I am attaching a matrix of prior language that has been used in connection with the major Israeli-Palestinianissues.It was prepared in the context of language the US might use if it were to articulate principles not principles to which theparties might agree but it provides most of the language that has been used in the past with citations.The USIP Middle East group Steve and I chair decided that rather than issue a static report we wouldprepare/commission a series of timely and specific papers that we would provide privately to the Administration. (I havesent some of those to your office). They include papers on security Palestinian institution building public attitudes inIsrael and the territories etc.I will deliver a set of those papers to your office on MondayIf it would be useful I would be happy to convene a small private discussion with some of the sharpest people in thegroup or give you some names.A few observations following up our call this am.:(1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don't think impossible. If Bibi can say he has securedunprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state he could decide toplay the historic leader. If he is uncompromising he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israelirelations. His opt out of course is to blame the Pais but we will be "in the room".(2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around i.e. notan early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel eachother out first at the level of first principles to be distilled after a period by the U.S.(3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately they need to establish some trust. But we (you orMitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has beenagreed and to move things along. .(4) On the critical issue of security I don't think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expectan IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitionalphase. Question is how long.(5) As you know Abbas' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently Ithink he is genuinely committed to an agreement. He hopes that if this fails Bibi will seem to beunreasonable. And in that event I expect he will resign. His minimal requirement is the equivalent of 1967.This is all tricky business but I don't think we have a responsible choice not to make this effort. It is the highest form ofstatesmanship for you to try.I am leaving on Monday for some foreign travel but can be reached through my office -- LauraHuberSandy",0

"I am Engr; Abubakar Saeed the director of works FMW&H Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transactionwhich involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$9.6000000.00 (Nine million six hundred united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say the trust reposed on you at this is enormous in return we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by you sending me a mail through my confidential email address so that I can brief you further (abu_saeed04@tiscali.co.uk).I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential as we are still in government servicewhich we intend to retire from. kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2004 financial year.Thanks and God bless.Engr; Abubakar Saeed.",1

"Attention pleaseCompliments to you; I sincerely apologize for the intrude into your private= life however I have a serious project which I believe would be of interes=t to you and for this reason I reached out to you. I am Barrister Kenneth O=bi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED=} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folde=d as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th =of June 1986 the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for =the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS which is from Jun=e 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insuranc=e Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Li=fe policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.In 1996 Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not term=inate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply fo=r cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006 I got a lett=er from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took =for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for furth=er discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Thre=e Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chair=man of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company =took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they ask=ed me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.Since 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I we=nt back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and sen=ile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything= for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to =get any of the Chairman=92s relative with his authorization to claim the s=urrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bea=ring same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surr=ender value. If we don't claim this money no one would and the money woul=d be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I fe=el it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use so=me percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society =than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.I contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the mone=y if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect a=nd regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to wh=oever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain for you all =that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I have in my fil=e some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life Policy. I will= send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send a claim appl=ication specimen to you which you will fill and send to the Insurance Comp=any for the release of the surrender value to your account. Your share for =assisting in this transaction will be One Million Dollars. If you cannot ex=ecute this transaction for any reason please introduce someone who is capa=ble and I will reward you with Fifty thousand dollars after the transaction=.

"Dear Sir/Madam You may be surprised to receive this letter from me Since you do not know me personally "My Name is THEMBI TENDAI" The purpose of my introduction is that Before the death of my father he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US6 Million (Six Million United States dollars)in one of the private security company as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black Farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father " Mudada Abba " was one of the victims. It is against this backround that I and my Mother and three younger ones fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and I currently staying in the Netherlands in a village called Zwolle where my family are seeking political asylum and more so I have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. As the eldest daughter of my father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future both countries have similar political history. As the Eldest daughter I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want feel free to notify me. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10%of the money while the remaining 90% will be for my investment in your country. Should you which to assist me please furnish me with your telephone and fax number me with the above via e-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. God Bless MISS THEMBI TENDAI",1

"Dear belovedMy name is Abdul Manoni A Bahrain nationalI have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatmentand right now I have only about a few months to live according tomedical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so wellas I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business.Though I am very rich I was never generous I was alwayshostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the onlything I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that thereismore to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in theworld. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to thisworld I wouldlive my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God has called me I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as afew close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soulso I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I wantthis to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I haveDistributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E Somaliaand Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot dothis myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one ofmy accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them.

I am Mrs Awa Keita the wife of late EL-MUSTAPHA KEITA of blessed memory. Before my husband was killed by forces loyal to MAJOR JOHNNY PAUL KOROMA he was the Director-General of Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation (GDMC) of Sierra-Leone.</DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>My husband targeted by the rebel forces in the course of the revolution. Two days before his death he managed to sneak a written message to us explaining his condition and concerning one trunk box of valuables containing money and gold which he deposited with a private Security &amp; Finance Company in Abidjan Cote d'Iviore.</DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>He instructed me to take our two children(Ibrahim and Zinat) and move out of Sierra-Leone immediately to Abidjan Cote d'Iviore before the Peace Keeping Forces of the Economic Community of West African States<BR>(ECOMOG) monitoring team intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by the rebels which was the order of the day. </DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>Eventually it resulted into full war. I became a widow overnight; helpless situation without partner. At that moment of calamity every person was running for his/her life. In the content of the deed he signed with the Security Company he used the name of his son Master Ibrahim Keita as the next of kin. The real content of the box were not disclosed to the Security Company due to security reasons. Now as a refugee we have very limited financial rights here we intend to leave this country immediately with the whole money for investment in your country because of the stable situation and mostly for the future benefits of my children. </DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>We have since applied for political asylum. The cash involved inside in the box is US$&nbsp;10.5 Million (&nbsp;Ten million and&nbsp;five hundred thousand united state dollars). I want you to assist us to claim the box from the Security Company as the new beneficiary so that the change ownership of the documents covering this consignment/box will be legally effected to your name as to enable you have this money deposited in a local account&nbsp;here in Abidjan in your name&nbsp;for the easier transfer of this money in to your oversaes bank account. </DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>We also source for good investment so that we can invest the money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding investment and good relationship with you. Concerning the money we are prepared to offer you a reasonable percentage of 20% of the total sum proceeds. Meanwhile 5% has been mapped out for any expenses you may incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for my family.</DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>For the interest of this business do not hesitate to contact us with the above email addresss immediately you receive this message for more information to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding all our arrangements. </DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>No other person knows about this money apart from my children and I. We await your most urgent response. </DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>Thanks for your co-operation and God bless you.</DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV>Best regards </DIV> <DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV></DIV>Madam Keita.</DIV></DIV><p><hr size=1> Yahoo!

"Good day You may be surprise to receive this letter from mesince you don't know me personally. I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bonganiwho was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. precisely More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistancewe are offering you 30% of the total sum60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finallyall we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country. If this proposal is acceptable by you please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. Best Regards. Jonathan Bongani(For the Family).",1

"FYIThe Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.comWar on terror: Obama softened the language buthardened Muslim heartsThe Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans' fear ofIslam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high.By Stuart Gottliebposted October 14 2010 at 9:58 am EDTNew Haven Conn. ‚ÄîOne of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America's rhetorical approachto the threat of terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language we use matters" President Obama told the Arabic satellite television stationAl Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W. Bush-era terms like "war on terrorism" "radical Islam" and"jihadist."The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term "Islamic terrorism" with "violent extremism."The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.First it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda not against Islamic extremism which Mr. Obama believescontributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was "at war with Islam." Indeed the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach tothe Muslim world to build "a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest."Second it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism which Obama officials believe plays directly into the hands ofextremists.Language change ineffectiveNow it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls suggest it hasn't. The first by theBrookings Institution in Washington shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism inObama's approach toward their region dropped from 51 percent to just 16 percent with those describing themselves as "discouraged" by the Obamapresidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.The second by the Pew Research Center shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30 percent) than five yearsearlier during the Bush administration (41 percent) with more Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions(in 2002 it was 25 percent).These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes terrorism is a propaganda-fueled activity ‚Äì anongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital‚Äì the counterproductive "smoke 'em out" rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point.But if rhetoric does not match policy or appears to discount or play down threats the credibility ‚Äì and thus effectiveness ‚Äì of the overallcounterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has dug itself into just such a hole.Rhetoric doesn't match policyWhen looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up thewar in Afghanistan; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes; continues to hold more than 1000 Muslim detainees in GuantanamoBagram and other prisons; and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.This is not to critique these policies but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddledObama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements.The price of downplaying the threatA large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line tactics ‚Äî the USA PatriotAct warrantless surveillance indefinite detentions the White House has consistently played down the threat even in the face of a clear uptick interrorism activity.For example following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing Obama described the suspect as an "isolated extremist" despite his ties to AlQaeda. And the administration's initial response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was tocall it a "one-off' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plotswere unconnected and unrelated to radical Islam.There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the public's trust. A Galluppoll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent ‚Äî up from 49percent to 42 percent last fall.Time to reverse the trendObama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism and in many ways he has. His instincts to maintain aggressivetactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound. Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years ‚Äî thatoverstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached. So too does rhetoric that understates the threat especially when detached from policy.It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric ‚Äî which has not paiddividends at home or abroad ‚Äî and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them.Stuart Gottlieb a former foreign-policy adviser and speechwriter in the US Senate (1999-2003) is now director of policy studies at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale.

"{ASYLUM SEEKER} BANGKOKTHAILAND AttnSir/Madam I got to know of you in my search for a reputable person/company to assist me in an urgent matter/business that would certainly boost the financial standard of all parties involved when completed which also requires utmost trust and confidentiality. I am Mr. Leonard Welsh Taylor first son to late Mr.Darby Assinga Taylor. who died last 3 years in the crisis in liberia western Africa. My late father is an aide to exile president Charles Taylor died as a result of uprising against his Government by rebel groups. Meanwhile before the death of my father he had taken me to Bangkok Thailand to deposit the sum of SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US Dollars ($7.5million US Dollars) in january 2001 at a Security Company. Initially he intended investing this money in a garment factory in Bangkok before the rebel forces assasinated him. This money was deposited as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was part of millions of dollars the president mapped out for the purchase of ammunitionsmilitaryhard/softwareslight and heavy duty vehicles and other defensive logistics. My late father sensing the weakness of the ruling Government he took me to Thailand in january to deposit the money in a private security company as family valuables of containing gemstones and financial documents. As he returned from arms negotiation from eastern Europe he was assasinated by the rebels forces on 11 april 2002 which prompted me to seek asylum in Thailand where the money and the whole documents are with me right now. This resulted to killing and mass action by the government and rebel soldiers. Infact a lot of people have been killed and they are still killing uptill now because of this war of which my father was one of the victims. Perhaps if you are conversant with world news you can understand me better. It is against this background that I am soliciting need your assistance to help and provide a foreign account for us especially sourcing for reliable and trustworthy ventures where the money will be invested when transferred to your account in your country Since the law of Thailand prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to operate a bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. I am in now saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account into which this money can be transferred without the knowledge of my home government who are bent on taking everything we have got. At the moment We are faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Thailand for fear of seizure or going through this same experience or seizure because of terrorist activitiesarcotics agencies. I am soliciting your willingness to help me explore possible areas we can invest our money in your country.and in a profitable business I would equally appreciate your willingness to help me relocate my immediate family of three to your country where I will invest the fund.The cash is ($7.5 MILLION US DOLLARS) means for the would-be project is under my custody. I will therefore appreciate it if you can travel to meet with me in bangkokThailand hence my permit (Refugee) only allows us to make a single trip out of the country gurranted asylum.Again to enable us have a memorandum of understanding discuss on likely profitable and reliable ventures where the money will be invested in your country and and also promise you 20% per! cent of the total fund for your assistance and support in making the transfer a success. after the consignment is released from storage. This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord me your unalloyed and due cooperation and willing to assist me please reply me and include your private E-mail/fax and telephone number. Note That this business is 100% risk free and your coming down here ",1

"Good DayI am Mr. Patrick Chan Executive Director and Chief FinancialOfficer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a concealed businesssuggestion for you.Our client Gen. Samir Abi Rahman who was with the Iraqi forcesand also businessman made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar monthswith a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand UnitedState Dollars only in my branch. Several maturities notices wassent to him even during the war which began in 2003. Again afterthe war another notification was sent and still no response camefrom him. We later found out that the General along with his wifeand only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blastthat hit their home.After more inquiry it was also discovered that Gen. Samir AbiRahman did not declare any next of kin in his official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confidedin me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knewof his deposit in my bank. So Twenty Four million Five HundredThousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and noone will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most isthat according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 5years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong KongGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against thisbackdrop my suggestion to you is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Samir Abi Rahmanso that you will be able to receive his funds.MODALITIES:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out sothat we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that willprepare the necessary document that will back you up as the nextof kin to Gen. Samir Abi Rahman. After you have been made the nextof kin the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf andsecure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favourfor the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter as we are goingadopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all thenecessarydocuments. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all mattersconcerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to yournominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 60% forme 40% for you.Should you be interested send me the following:1 Full names2 private phone number3 current residential addressAnd I prefer you reach me on my private email address below:(patrickchan202@yahoo.com.hk) and finally after I shall provide youwith moredetails on this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind RegardsMr. Patrick Chan.",1
"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16iht-edcohen.html?2=1&emc=eta18pagewanted=printJuly 15 2010Inners arid LosersEy ROGER COHENNEW YORK ‚Äî The Clintons threw a big Washington bash on June 30 for Hillary Clinton's longtime aide Hume Abedinand what struck one of the many guests was the absence of anyone from President Obama's tight White House innercircle.Congressional heavyweights thronged the garden of the Clinton spread on Embassy Row including House SpeakerNancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin'smarriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.Well as Bill Clinton told CNN recently "I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win" ‚Äîold wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the oldgrievances not going away the response from the hosts went something like this:No they don't and they never will. But we're public servants and suckers for punishment so we soldier on.Speaking of soldiering on Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4 she was inArmenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.‚Äî equally thankless task ‚Äî mediate between Armenia andTurkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.You've got to salute Hillary. She's got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It's a heck of a job being secretary of statewhen the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues ‚Äî Afghanistan Iran Israel-Palestine and Iraq ‚Äî andyou're left with Nagorno-Karabakh disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and if you're lucky U.S. bases on Okinawa.The situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House ‚Äî and they are overwhelmingly boys ‚Äî wereforeign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed I'm told Henry Kissinger refers to them as "the kids."Chief among them according to my colleague Helene Cooper is Denis McDonough the National Security Council's chiefof staff. Earlier this month Cooper wrote: "Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary RobertM. Gates. When it comes to national security Mr. Obama's inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough a40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans."I do know McDonough and I've spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the state's qualities: positivebrisk can-do affable and efficient.But am I reassured when! read that Obama's national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a greatguy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign ‚Äî as he did to perfection for Obama ‚Äî but he's not a great guy tothink big about the world.Thinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are anAfghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests ‚Äî which will require a bruising negotiationwith the Taliban ‚Äî and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctionshave changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.Then there's Israel-Palestine where Obama can't decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on bothsides ‚Äî is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel with the result that he's zigzagging to little effect.After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-policy house is divided ‚Äî and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones his national security adviser speaks fine French ‚Äîthe French love that ‚Äî but he's left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon Jones' deputy dances around the vacuumas best he can. Like McDonough David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists but should theybe foreign-policy strategists?In Clinton Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-Karabakh? The State Department a repository of Other underused talent cannot be the White House annex for non-critical affairs.Back in the 1860s James Gordon Bennett then the editor of the New York Herald a forebear of the International HeraldTribune gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley:"Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that draw another thousand and when that is spentdraw another thousand and when you have finished that draw another thousand and so on; but FIND LIVINGSTONE."He was referring to the lost African explorer David Livingstone whom Stanley eventually tracked down on LakeTanganyika uttering the immortal words: "Doctor Livingstone I presume?"That sort of journalism's gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and tellingMichael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece Hastings did that. He also foundsomething else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it.McChrystal's gone but not the dysfunction. A blow-up I presume? Watch this space.",0

"November 23 2010Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. GroupsBeginsBy MICHAEL LUOIn what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections David Brock a prominent Democratic politicaloperative says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to setup what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outsidegroups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections.Kathleen Kennedy Townsend a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 childrenhas agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group which will be called American Bridge lending to the still extremelynascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics.Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay heir to the Taco Bellfortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson who headsDyson-Kissner-Moran a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey a television producer whogave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004.Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday toset up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee meaning it willbe able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors.Certain to set off debate however is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raisingconsultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one ofthe nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs Media Matters Action Network which does not disclose its donors.The action network which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations is organized as a 501(c)(4)nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections including potentially running television adsaccording to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtainedby The New York Times.Mr. Brock said that "money is money" and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and in the end the mediaspending would be apportioned accordingly.The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists toestablish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on theright as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce American Crossroads and others which significantly outspent Democratic-leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giantcontributions on the left.Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction afterthe Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups.But Mr. Brock a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s is a respected politicalplayer who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Mattersumbrella.Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year.Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1million to the group; Peter B. Lewis the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance who like Mr. Soros gave morethan $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing."My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollarsto these types of efforts" Mr. Brock said. "They just need to be asked and I have no doubt they will step up at this criticaltime."There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to bemore heavily involved in the 2012 elections.White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic-leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward suchgroups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed.The lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year asspending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections.But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some ofwhat was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raisemoney if the option of offering anonymity is available."It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on to essentially tie one hand behind your back" Mr. McKay said.Besides Mr. Brock numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts.On Monday for instance Steve Rosenthal who was the chief executive of America Coming Together a Democratic fund-raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election convened a group of political operatives many ofwhom were active in that election at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012.No one however has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up anorganization.Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the endof the first quarter of 2011.By way of comparison America's Families First Action Fund one of the major Democratic independent efforts in Houseraces this year raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October.The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year including initially focusingon attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House as a prelude to major spending in 2012.",0

This business request may seem strange but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32500000.00) First of all I am an accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.ÔøΩI am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC) I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with ! a very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;ÔøΩ(i) As government employees we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the foreign firms only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is first to furnish us with the following through my email address.1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )2.) The beneficiary's name3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria ",1

Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through this mediumbased on business proposal that will be of mutualbenefit to both of us. I got your particulars througha consultant company base on my research for atrustworthy and established person that understandsinvestment ethic for entering into a life timeprofitable joint partnership investment and alsoco-operation with confidence and trust that you willkeep the contents secret and divulged to any thirdparty.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997 a reputable client of ours deposited aconsignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.And since then our client has failed to come forwardto claim his consignment which has accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently in our bide to contact this client toredeem the demurrage which his consignment hadaccumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since the death of our client President MobutouSeseseko none of his benefactors has come forward toclaim the consignment with us which means that non ofhis relatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided tosecretly open the two boxes that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that thetwo boxes that were registered as treasurer by ourclient actually contained a considerable amount ofmoney in United States Dollars amounting to aboutUS$30 million Dollar. Since this development I havebeen nursing plans secretly. I also found out fromenquiries and the foreign media that our late clientsiphoned a lot of money from his country while he wasin office as head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment in our vaultwas part of the money that our client siphoned and nowthat he is dead there is no race to this money in ourcare.I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist mein transferring this money out of nigeria to yourcountry for immediate investment with your assistance.I have also decided that you will generously beentitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receiptof your reply confirming your willingness to assist meof this transaction I will immediately arrange andtransfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment to your name to facilitate your easyclearance and transfer of the complete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintain absolute confidentiality on thismatter.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.

"PVerveerSunday March 28 2010 9:03 PMFwd: FW: Recruit Afghan women to sell war to Europeans: CIA reportInteresting.Recruit Afghan women to sell war to Europeans: CIA reportWASHINGTON March 27 2010 (AFP) - A CIA expert has called for recruiting Afghan women in a publicrelations bid to persuade skeptical Europeans to support the NATO-led war effort according to a documentleaked Friday."Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing" the mission for European audiencesparticularly in France according to the CIA analysis posted on WikiLeaks a whistleblower website.The views of Afghan women would carry special weight as they could express "their aspirations for the futureand their fears of a Taliban victory" it said.The Central Intelligence Agency declined to confirm or deny if the document was genuine. But WikiLeaks haspreviously posted government and corporate documents that were later verified.The report by a CIA expert on "strategic communications" and State Department analysts of public opinionwarned that popular support for the war in Europe was weak and could easily collapse citing the recent fall ofthe Dutch government over the issue."The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civiliancasualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediatewithdrawal" it said.The analysis dated March 11 suggested public relations strategies to drum up support for the war in Germanyand France which maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan."Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with FrenchGerman and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in WesternEurope toward the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission" it said.Public relations efforts could "tap into acute French concern for civilians and refugees" the report saidsuggesting highlighting polls that show most Afghans support the presence of coalition troops.Such an approach could stress the potential dangers facing Afghan civilians if NATO-led troops were defeatedand "leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them.""The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls I- education could provoke Frenchindignation become a rallying point for France's largely secular public and give voters a reason to support agood and necessary cause despite casualties."For German audiences marketing efforts should underline how Afghans are reportedly optimistic about theNATO mission and how an international retreat would damage Germany's interests."For example messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germany's exposure toterrorism opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics" it said.The report also suggested taking advantage of President Barack Obama's popularity in France and Germanyarguing that appeals from the US president on the importance of the allied role in the war could have a positiveeffect.The memorandum is titled: "Afghanistan: Sustaining West European Support for the NATO-led Mission -- WhyCounting on Apathy Might Not Be Enough."Media Analysis and Watch CenterUSSTRATCOM Foreign Media Analysis ProgramSOS International Ltd.www.sosiltd.com",0

"HelloThis letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu a merchant in Dubai in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital. Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you. ",1

""I am Hon. Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking my agitation is real and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions as he believed.As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director Safety and Security Department we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad that will stand as the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.In addition you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer but only if by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.Best regardsHon.

Those planning to vote in thespecial election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 pointmargin in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state.That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governorin Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of Republicans say they're 'veryexcited' about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment.Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote whileCoakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relativelypopular with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with apositive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative.Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obama'shealth care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the President'soverall job performance 44/43."The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats" saidDean Debnam President of Public Policy Polling. "Martha Coakley's complacentcampaign has put Scott Brown in a surprisingly strong position and she will need to stepit up in the final week to win a victory once thought inevitable."PPP surveyed 744 likely Massachusetts voters from January 7th to 9th. The margin oferror is +/-3.6%. Other factors such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting mayintroduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify.Complete results are attached and can be found at www.publicpolicypolling.com.",0
"Dear FriendAttention Please.Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven MillionFive Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker)we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please you have been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communicationYours faithfullyDr Idris Ali._________________________________________________________________Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bÔøΩta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d",1

"I heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not who are we sending?",0
"Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to youso that the money can be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody will come for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed dormant fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arrangedyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin to the deceased customer with a text of application that i will send to youbut before i send to you the text of application formI will like you to send me the following informations.1.

The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. TheCouncil urges Israel to permit full consular access to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased andwounded immediately and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination.

"Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeablydifferent. First people across the spectrum - DC insiders reporters staff ex-staff friends of friends WH folks etc -were blown away. Second people were REALLY moved by the last segment three people even told me they teared up.I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin with mixed messages and bad news coupled withmany people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with thePresident and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a classall your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key you turned it into a strength. What you said about the Presidentand how you said it one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted tothe role.You were definitely on your game.

"Car bomb explodes in Northern IrelandRepublican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place‚Ä¢ Buzz up!‚Ä¢ Diqg it‚Ä¢ Mark Tran‚Ä¢ quardian.co.uk Tuesday 23 February 2010‚Ä¢ Article historyA car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry Northern Ireland police said. There were no initialreports of any injuries in the blast.Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were inthe process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after amortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry Gary McKeown condemned those responsible. "Lives could have beenlost as a result of this bombing" he said. "It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community or thecause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs they should enter the democratic process and debatewith their political opponents rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing."Earlier this month police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll thefirst PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon County Armagh on 9 Marchlast year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks inAntrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.On Sunday Republican Sinn Fein political allies of the Continuity IRA claimed masked undercover soldiers carried outsurveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan Co Armagh in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting theareas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.The alleged presence of SRR soldiers ‚Äî formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit ‚Äî is controversial because Britishtroops are meant to have been pulled off the streets especially in nationalist areas.Britain heading for hung parliamentGuardian/ICM pollTories might not win election outright suggests new survey‚Ä¢ Comments (259)‚Ä¢ Buzz up!‚Ä¢ Digq it‚Ä¢ Julian Glover‚Ä¢ quardian.co.uk Monday 22 February 2010 18.30 GMT‚Ä¢ Article historyThe Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright according to a Guardian/ICM poll publishedtoday.The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron'sparty.The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues including the economy and in particular may be losing theircampaign against Labour's so-called "death tax". Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policyon care for the elderly.The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis against a nine-point Tory lead when thequestion was last asked in August 2009.With no more than three months to go until polling day the Conservatives have fallen to 37% down three on last month'sGuardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis last falling to 37% in February 2008.As recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that therace is tightening which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.Meanwhile Labour's support at 30% is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May and slightly above itsaverage for the second part of last year. However there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown'sPiers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend's reports about Brown bullying his staff.Labour's support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Researchbegan last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley's book in yesterday's Observerwhich may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday.Nick Clegg's hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today's poll which puts the LiberalDemocrats on 20% unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month's Guardian poll.All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smallerparties which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5% Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary but a 7% lead is at the margins of whatthe Tories think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25seats behind the Tories in a hung parliament although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offsetthat.‚Ä¢ /CMResearch interviewed a random sample of 1004 adults by telephone on 19-21 February 2010.

"Dear friendAs you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I Believe Everyone will die someday. My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and Right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18000000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.mr.

"The Secretary's Phone Call with Egyptian President MubarakBackground: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo.While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agreeto proximity talks Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israelhas taken action on the "five steps" requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh which Solimon attended in part. Egypt andJordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks but the three sides also agreed that Abbas wouldseek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. wouldpresent its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. DeputyEnvoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5 during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference(he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasizethat it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that willrealize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.",0

"Dear Sir This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to help me choose somebody that will be my true partner. My name is James Nandu Savimbi.I am the first son of Mr. Jonas Savinbi the leader of the UNITA movement in Angola. May be you know that my father was killed recently in Angola by the Angolan Government soldiers and he has since been buried. Two weeks before he died (May be he knows he will die) he called me and showed me a box containing US$20 million and some Diamond value about US$15 million. He sent the box to a security company in Europe for safe keeping with a false name. He give me the certificate of deposit and the code number. With that I can collect the box anytime I want. Now that my father is dead and I need the money to take care of the family left behind of about two wives and six children. I am now hiding as the government of Angola is desperately looking for me to assasinate and also the former commander of my father wants to get me at all cost.Also I have to be very careful of my movement hence my search for you to help me to get the box and keep it until I can escape and meet you and you will also help me to invest the money in your country or where it is good. I will give provide you with all the power(necessary documents) to collect the box on my behalf when you tell me in your reply that you will help me and I can trust and count on you. I don't trust anybody in Angola and with the certificate and the code which I will give you there should/will be no problem in collecting the box. You don't have to worryas this is 100% risk free to you as only me my dead father and the security company in Europe knows about this box. But I want you to keep this secret as there are some enemies of my father scattered all over the whole World who are friends to the government of Angola. The name of the country where the box is in Europe and how much I will give you for help shall be revealed upon your response to my mail. 1 YOUR FULL NAME 2. YOUR CONTACT (HOME)ADDRESS 3.

Suppose too that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then though not by the landslide of 1932. Howdifferent subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employmentcollapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened.On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power closeto the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alasit was not. I noted on February 4 2009 at the beginning of the new presidency: "Instead of an overwhelming fiscalstimulus what is emerging is too small too wasteful and too ill-focused." A week later I asked: "Has Barack Obama'spresidency already failed? In normal times this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They aretimes of great danger. Today the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow it will ownit. Today it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today it is in control of events; tomorrowevents will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much." This was right.The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers ‚Äî though not all economists ‚Äî had learnt a great deal from the 1930s.Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed together with reconstruction of thefinancial sector.But as Larry Summers Mr Obama's chief economic adviser had said: "When markets overshoot policymakers mustovershoot too". Unfortunately the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claimthat policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate.In consequence the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion havedisappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious too the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavyjoblessness is high. So too are the chances of domestic and global political friction.True the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this onewere far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder former vice-chairman of theFed and Mark Zandi of Moody's argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model toassess what would have happened without any intervention without the financial interventions (including monetary policy)and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have beenclose to 12 per cent with no policy response compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly theunemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would alsohave meant a fiscal deficit of $2600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal responsebut no financial ‚Ä¢olic res‚Ä¢onse. It is a little better the other way round.The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 ‚Äî a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP spread overseveral years ‚Äî made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it arguesthat in 2010 US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and1.8 percentage points lower as a result of the package.Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium unless governments intervene disagree. I wishthere were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowingthe collapse of much of the financial system avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscaldeficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre.A fascinating perspective does come however from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. Therecession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small but the decline in employment has been exceptionallylarge as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen tooutput and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of thestimulus.Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover sincefiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output not jobs this is a policy success. At the same time theenthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt some of this is due to the collapse inconstruction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives formanagers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs.Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer from European experience isthat one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run the simplest way to prevent that fromhappening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market not the slightest threat ofinflation ‚Äî far more a risk of deflation ‚Äî and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary andfiscal stimulus these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet alas the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep andthe administration has lost the initiative.So what is going to happen? I assume that after the midterm elections resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts andignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus though it is much the samething ‚Äî increasing fiscal deficits thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It wouldhave to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their"yacht and mansion-led" recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Thosewho were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price.martin.wolf@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/martinwolfCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

"Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first round voting David was ahead. But when thevotes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon but evenmore a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour. Ed hadmore labor union votes for leader which accounted for one-third of total. Ed's "new generation" rhetoric covers thatregression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet due to a new decision will be elected by the party.Ed is the former environment minister and good on green issues of course but has no foreign policy perspectiveyet instinctively to the left which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently conceived it should go without saying.David lost precisely because he held responsible positions.Sid",0
"FROM MR.ABDUL UMARDIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDITINGAND ACCOUNTING SECTION OF BANQUEGENERALE DU TOGOLOME-TOGO IN WEST AFRICA.DEAR FRIENDPermit me to use this medium to first introduce myself to you before getting you acquinted with the transaction for which i am contacting you. I am Mr ABDUL UMAR the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of BANQUE GENERALE DU TOGO Lome Togo in west Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction thatwill be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 31st October 1999 in a plane crash;flight number 990 en route from new york to cairo which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing the 217passengers and crew members on board and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.Although personally I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was us$14M (fourteen million united states dollars). As it may interest you to know I got yourimpressive information from the web directory of my country when searching for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who could help me champion a business proposal of such magnitude without any problem.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon asyou indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why itwill require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by thecorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 20% of the total sum asgratification while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills while 75% will be for me and my partners.Please you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in active service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to yourcountry for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.

"Good DayWith warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy if this contact is not acceptable to you as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct I selected your email address from an internet directory in my search for a partner hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola led by President Dos Santos on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command assumed office as leader of UNITA due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions including Mr.Dembo planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now not so much of the struggle interested me anymore as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million) which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad to ground UNITA and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Also ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name from the Security company after which the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance I will reward you with 15%($2775000) of the money. I have with me the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit which will be used for claim from the security company and the release codes of the vaults. Also everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africaewsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerelyO.C.Savimbi.",1

"Dear FriendI apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life But please treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you in the best of health.I am Mrs will dera ahmed born melika diouf banking profession mother of three childrenthe manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision of a foreign account  5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% be for me.Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effectivecommunication and location where the money will be transfer.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mailTrusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mrs MELIKA DIOUF",1
"Dear Sir I work with a Bank called IBTC in my country in the foreignexchange department and I'm the deputy head of my department.Our major objective is the operation of foreign accouunts forstates and highly placed citizens of my country and othercountries especially those at the helm of affairs andsuccessful business men.We also make sure the Forex market iswell controlled and checked.One of those highly and successfully placed citizen is JosephNanven Garba (Major General Rtd). Until his demise he heldsensitive positions in the military and diplomat seat one ofthe office he held  was the position of the personal assistantto the U.N secretary general Koffi Annan. His death was a shockto the entire nation the man in quote operates several foreignaccounts in our department which I mannage myself due to hisposition in the country. Such operations of accounts is called"Private Banking" where the deposits will only be known to theowner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge.Normally65% of the total deposit is supposed to be turned intothe Federal Government account and 30% 5% given to the familyand bank respectively. This is what the banking law and policyof my country states When this is achieved i.e transfer of theFederal Government account part the people at the corridors ofpower withdraw these funds under the disguise of security issuesbut make use of theseFunds for their personal and family use.This is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of theaccount and the family of the deceased. So I released the code ofthe account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit.Since the code of the account is in between me and the deceasedthe fear of being checked is ruled out but I cannot makewithdrawals from this account myself and that is where you comein.All you need to do for this transaction is to follow theprocedure binding this contract together and I guarantee youit&#8217;s risk free.

I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.I am Mrs. Susan Martins the wife of Mr. John Martins of Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country all the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm.After the death of my husband my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$305 Million (Thirty Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa where we deposited it with a private Security Company as a valuables in a box/consignment. This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the total money while 75% will be for my family.

I have a concealed business suggestion for you.B=efore the U.S and Iraqi war our client General.

"Dearest in the Lord I am the above named person from South Africa. I am married to Mr.GREOGE SANKOH who worked with South African embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 5.5Million U.S.(FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDERD thousand Dollars) in a trunk box in one ( Security And Finance Company) in cote d' ivoire.Presently this money is still with the Security And Finance Company. Recently my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next two years due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this to fund churches orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the BANK in ivory coast.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you as soon as you received this mail .

"See the report below: Pinera has announced his support.I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile including his closefriendAccording to Craig Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparentlythere is a coalition leadership in the lower house and Insulza's party Concertacion controls the upper house. So he hadno choice.That said Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave hissupport with two conditions: (1) don't interfere in Chilean politics and (2) take the democratization agenda seriouslyand don't carry the ALBA countries' water.Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that hadan impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him.Bottom line: Craig said we couldn't have talked Pinera off of this but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions onPinera's support.",0

"August 8 2010Gary SickAmerica and Iran: Strikes Sanctions and ScapegoatsFor the pundits there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israeland/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to changeits nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues the answers are an easy no and no.Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table thereby giving the pundits (and thecrowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pageswhere it has been for years. As a lede it sells columns and newspapers so it will not go away. But as analysis itis either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur it would have been at the end of the Bushadministration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted itunequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed judging from hissubsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush after looking the potentialconsequences resisted the advice of his neocon advisers his previously dominant vice president and thereported direct request from the government of Israel ‚Äî and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that BarackObama with the same catastrophic scenario before him will approve? Forget it.Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their securityand survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraqin the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out ofIraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet although Iraq hadabandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people andhis enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that therewas no immediate necessity to come clean. They after all controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmenmanaged the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people a rotundTariq Aziz sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar informed a worried UN representative that it would begood for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions hadmade criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. Thebiggest ‚Äì and most successful ‚Äì of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around SaddamHussein.Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web offinancial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significantproblems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because ofcheap energy prices inside the country artificially propped up by massive subsidies energy demand is soaring.This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hardcurrency.At the same time because Iran's oil fields are old and complex they require modern technology to maintainproduction. That technology ‚Äì and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oilcompanies ‚Äì has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions ironically assisted byIran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outsideinvestors. As a result Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soakedup by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices this means that Iran's hard currencyearnings are drying up at an alarming rate.This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competenteconomic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i the Supreme Leaderseems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the RevolutionaryGuards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regimecould have imagined.President Ahmadinejad also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards is free to indulge his taste for outlandishand irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effectdrives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctionsagainst Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossadagent: no one he observed had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At thesame time under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.But to be fair Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the "third rail" ofIranian politics ‚Äî the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount ofsubsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation including torching filling stations.But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He is nowaddressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage including closingthe bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer including theInternational Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economicinterests by his belligerent rhetoric always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembleshis populist predecessors from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America andIsrael the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of hisown eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iranis capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. TheRevolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military its economy and its politics. Iranincreasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s thatwe call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons from the millenarians on the far rightwho choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth to the pragmaticconservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership to the reformists of the Green movement whoseobjective is to put the "republic" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration willback the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied withdomestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it willinadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoatfor everything that goes wrong in Iran.",0
"EMAILjamesnzama012@hotmail.comPHONE:+ 27-833413608NAME :JAMES NZAMAAttention president/ceo.Your contact was made possible by your country's Trade Journal at the World Trade Centre here in Harare Zimbabwe and I decided to write for assistance. You may be surprised to receive this letter since you do not know me personallyfirst let me introduce myselfI am Mr.JAMES NZAMA the son of Late Mr. NZAMA KUMALO who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the special agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by whites.Before his death he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$20.100.000.00 (Twenty Million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he forsaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as a consignment for the Security Company to avoid seizure and also to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was earnmarked for the purchase of new machinery andchemicals for the farm and establishment for the new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when president Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government that resulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war veterans and some political thugs precisely more than thirty one people(31) have been killed.Heads of government from Western worlds especially Britain and the USA have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently the South African Development Community (S.A.D.C.) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land reform act. It is against this background that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa have decided to transfer my father's money into a foreign account.As the eldest son of my father I am saddled with the resposibilty of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could transferred without the knowledge of my government who had tactically frozen our family wealth and the South African government seem to be playing along withthem.I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of seizure and encountering the same experience in the future since both countries have almost the same political history. Moreso the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow suchinvestment since I am an asylum seeker.As a businessman whom I must entrust my future and that of my family on his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free. Therefore if you accept to assist us we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance. 60% will be for my family while 10%will be fo all expenses.If this proposal is acceptable to you please send me an email but you should know that this business is highly confidential and shall be kept within yourself.So I will hang on until I hear from you.Best regardsJamesFrom r Thu Jun 3 14:37:51 2004 with ESMTP id <0HYQ003H0X1L49@mcmmta3.mediacapital.pt> for",1

"Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying toimplement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We haveorganized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English languagetraining; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chairedby senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly etc. --- and are being asked to report backwithin 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward.The New Public DiplomacyJoseph S. Nye2010-02-10CAMBRIDGE ‚Äî The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy wouldwin. In today's information age politics is also about whose "story" wins.National narratives are indeed a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with otherorganizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest betweenthe government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009 in which the Internet and Twitter playedcrucial roles or the recent controversy between Google and China.Reputation has always mattered in world politics but credibility has become crucial because of a "paradox ofplenty." When information is plentiful the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions a soft sellmay more than ever prove more effective than a hard sell.For example the relative independence of the BBC sometimes a source of consternation to Britishgovernments has paid rich dividends in credibility as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President JakayaKikwete's day: "he rises at dawn listens to the BBC World Service then scans the Tanzanian press."Skeptics who treat the term "public diplomacy" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simplepropaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relationscampaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environmentfor government policies.The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with threedimensions or stages of public diplomacy and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimensionis daily communications which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. Thisdimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an eventothers will rush in to fill it.The second dimension is strategic communication which develops a set of simple themes much as a politicalor advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days the second occurs overweeks months and even years.The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals overmany years or even decades through scholarships exchanges training seminars conferences and access tomedia channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called thecrucial "last three feet" ‚Äî face-to-face communications with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if itcuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often policymakers treat publicdiplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example China triedto enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics but its domestic simultaneous crackdownin Tibet ‚Äî and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers ‚Äî undercut its gains.Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage but they do notalways understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreignpolicy undercuts its credibility. Instead they advocate diplomacy "on steroids" staffed by diplomats trained innew media cross-cultural communications granular local knowledge and networks of contacts with under-represented groups.The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need tocorrect daily misrepresentations of their policies as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message.The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awarenessand set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in differentcultural settings. The sender knows what she says but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are aptto distort what is heard.Networked communications on the other hand can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult forgovernments to accomplish given their central accountability structures.The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call"the new public diplomacy" which is no longer confined to messaging promotion campaigns or even directgovernmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about buildingrelationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmentalparties at home and abroad.In this approach to public diplomacy government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in rather thancontrolling such cross-border networks. Indeed too much government control or even the appearance of it canundercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy fromone-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.Power in a global information age more than ever will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the harddimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called "smart power." For-example the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds andover-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success.Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power but smart public diplomacy requires anunderstanding of credibility self-criticism and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If itdegenerates into propaganda public diplomacy not only fails to convince but can undercut soft power. Insteadit must remain a two-way process because soft power depends first and foremost upon understanding theminds of others.",0

"STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIALYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know mepersonally the purpose of my introduction is that I am MR.DAVID PEDRO thefirst SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centrehere in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of myfather he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS)in a Security Company as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for thefarms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problemcame when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact a lot of people have been killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims.It is against this background that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar political history. Moreover the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker. As a business man whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his hands I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into anyaccount you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever the option you want feel free to notify me as I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I Implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please you should keep this transaction secret and confidential. contact me on this mail direct email:davpe@myway.comAnd send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following:1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.2) YOUR FULL NAME.3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.PLEASE YOU CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE AND HOW MY FATHER DIED FROM THE LINKS BELOW.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/918781.stmhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/715001.stmhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1063785.stmhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/862220.stmhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/864554.stmhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/870444.stm",1

"Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the keyparagraph. Jake I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 oA Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau islands which the U.S. took in war andsubsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 11994 includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years including full U.S. military authority --although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is tocontinue in perpetuity.The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15years but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th 30th and40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands'development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economicdevelopment.A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur Chief Representative for Compact Review JoshuaKoshiba Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei Ambassadorto the U.S. Hersey Kyota Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck and their consultants met in Honolulu on July8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Officeof Australia New Zealand and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick the head of the US Delegation and representatives ofthe Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services.The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number ofthe U.S. delegation's statements however evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as wellas the letter of the Compact the relationship as a whole Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibilitycommitments and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in theU.S. military the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture and Palau's positions inthe U.N.Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compactdeepen the relationship and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positiveexpressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both politicalparties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and topositions befitting the great nation that is the United States.Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and thatthe U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officialscan be needed.Because of this because of the confidence that it has in the United States and because it would not be productive toelaborate with others on the conversations at this stage Palau's representatives are confining additional comment toofficial communications.B6",0

""	HelloIt is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request. I am writing you to solicit your assistance in a business partnership that could be of mutual benefit to both of us. I hope that you read thoroughly and response as promptly as possible. Precisely in the year 2000 the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a Manager of 14 Project Allocation received presidential irrevocable circular order requesting the ministry to compile and forward the list of all past foreign contractors whose contract payments are pending since the period of the past government of Dr Nelson Mandela and the present government.The purpose of this presidential order is that the present South Africa elected government will pay foreign contractors all debts owned and thus maintaining a good relationship with other foreign government and non-governmental financial agencies. In light of the above my partner and I duty is to compile a list of these contractors. We have decided to include a company name with a bill of {USD25 Million United State Dollars} along side other company names and their respective bill for payments. The {Alliance Mining SA PTY} which was incorporated for this operation also carried out contractual works for the ministries as well as others.With the co-operation of top senior partner of mine we are confident that our claim of {USD25Million} shall be granted being for contract work executed at the Ministry of Minerals and Energy payment shall then be transferred upon approval to a safe account that would be provided by you in other words if you accept to be our partner then you shall be considered given the pertinent documentation to certify that your company had been awarded a contract already executed for which your company shall be paid the sum of USD25Million. Please be informed that with the South Africa government monetary policy. Government official's employees are not allowed to operate or to own bank account abroad hence our decision to seek a foreign partner.However the legitimacy of this transaction is well pronounced which I will personally explain to you by fax or telephone if you agree to be our partner to determine your true position. I have the authority and consent of my partner to offer this transaction to you. You will be highly compensated with a percentage upon mutual agreement by both parties after a successful completion of this project. Further information concerning the transaction shall be forwarded to you upon your response to this letter.I can assure you that my partners and I are in a position to make this payment claim possible provided you can give us the assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured. Visualize this opportunity as an indirect financial resource; also note that your area of specialization is not a hindrance in the successful execution of this transaction endeavour to contact me immediately by the above alternative email address because we will not compromise this transaction with any form of exposure as we are still in active civil service.Please keep this close to your chest as much as possible; we can not afford any political problems.Thank you and God bless as I await for a long term mutually beneficially relationship for both of us.Yours FaithfullyDr Abraham Maliba.

I am Mr.Anuka Ifufeh the Auditor General of NED BANK PLC here South Africa during the course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank 1995 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is Mr. Franklin Sullivan a foreigner a miner and an industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died misteriously .Since 1998 no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it. My investigation proved to me that the account has no other beneficiary and that Mr. Franklin Sullivan until his death was the manager Sullivan Coy.(pty). SA. We will start the first transfer with Thirty six million dollars [$36000000.00] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.The amount involved is (USD $136M) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars only. I want to first transfer $36000.000 [Thirty Six Million United States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest but I don't know any foreigner.I am revealing this to you with believing God that you will never let me down in this business. Also send your private telephone number and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this business proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank official whom is working in our favour we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country@least two days ahead of the money going into the account. At the conclusion of this business you will be given 35% of the total amount 60% will be for me while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.Best RegardsMr.Anuka Ifufeh.",1

Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to theUSA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment wasintended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators.His colleague Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) spoke in opposition agreeing with committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed."I would just point to the actual language in here" Klobuchar said "which is it's not like this is some pie-in-the-sky standard here. I mean it specifically says" she noted approvingly reading aloud from the bill that therehave to be "reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized nationalsecurity investigation" and you can't investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and there's gotto be some suspected foreign agent involved."So I just for anyone listening to this it is not like there is no standard" she concluded. "There is a standard inplace here.""That's the standard that is in the bill now?" Sessions asked.Klobuchar nodded that it was.No it's not Durbin interrupted. "Senator Klobuchar you just read my amendment" not the bill he said -- "and Ithink it's critically important that you understand what we're establishing here."Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment which got only a handful of votes anyway.Blame the gatekeeperThe usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day ofwork and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heedtheir expert advice. (They are by nature an optimistic crowd.)Then after 7 months 8 days and 12 hours on average the grumbling begins that the secretary is "notaccessible" to senior career folks that she's overly protected by her personal staff that the promised "opendoor" has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing usually at the secretary's chief of staff. These days that'sCheryl Mills who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.We're hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staffcounselor overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay not really) --has made entry to Clinton's suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad.Not so says Undersecretary of State William Burns the department's top career official. "This secretary is intouch every day with as many people across the department as possible and Cheryl is a big part of making thathappen."Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August andIreland and Moscow just the other day and soon she'll be back on the road pretty much until Thanksgiving.There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters.Hey just telling you what we're hearing.In a timely fashion ...The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department's personnel bureau. The bureauin an Oct. 13 notice said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West LafayetteInd. to "assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have beenprofessionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatestpossibility of success in the foreign service."Well good thing the department's only been hiring for a couple of hundred years.The rest of the r√©sum√©The White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson a nuclear expertand senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group to be a member of theDefense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs even her undergraduate degree innuclear engineering.Name sounds familiar. Roberson Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee as assistant secretary of the EnergyDepartment for environmental management the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's notmentioned in the White House release but she was there from 2001 to 2004.Waterboarding for kids?WGDB Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal Sen.John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federaldeficits which are not for him an abstraction."It is deeply personal with me" Coburn explained. "I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes and I see thepotential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going towaterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to floodthem with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are going to limit their possibilities because wedon't have the courage to make the difference for their future."Wait a minute! It's just a dunk in the water.¬© 2009 The Washington Post Company",0

" Dear Sir/Madam I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland. I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field). All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased. The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud AlkharjÔøΩs property for her and her son. You must be asking where I got your mail address it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running if you are interested to assist us all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing you as the only beneficiary. The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not permanently resident in Switzerland. For your assistance we made up of I 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are concerned as they will be going to the surviving wife and child. If you are okay with the above explanations you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine after which we will make more information available to you on how we will proceed. I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com. We await your timely response. Best Regards DR PETER CLAPTON",1

He assured me of your capability and releability to champion thisbusiness opportunity.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on Monday31 July 2000in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unlesssomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon thisdiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into thebank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such moneyremained unclaimed after four years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 5% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locationwherein the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for more explanations.Yours faithfullyDR YUSUF SAMI._________________________________________________________________DÔøΩcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! www.windowslivemessenger.fr",1

" SEEKING FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION Zimbabwe formerly Rhodesia under the colonial rule gained independence in 1981 under the nationalist struggle for independence led by Mr. Robert Mugabe and late Joshua Nkomo. Under the white rule and since independence the minority whites that owned most of the farmlands in Zimbabwe have dominated agriculture. The aborigines believe that they are still slaves in their own land if they continue to work the lands for their whites masters even after independence. Robert Mugabe as the black Moses who led his people to freedom has vowed to revoke ownership of the white owned farms and redistribute the lands to the landless blacks. This move he said is necessary to redress the imbalance of the colonial era. For the struggle for freedom to affect this initiative the government has amended its land acquisition laws and policies last few months which gave about 3000 white Zimbabwean farmers a 45-day quit notice to leave their lands to the government. My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland a neighbouring country where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer. With a capital base of US$25.5Million there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South Africa. We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa. This money is presently deposited confidentially with A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out 25% of the gross sum as due commission for your expected honest assistance in executing the successful transfer of this money out of South Africa for our family investments. Please email us immediately if you are interested so we can discuss further while we hold this correspondence in the strictest confidence. Thanks and God bless you. Yours truly Evan Smith",1

"sbwhoeopMonday August 23 2010 10:06 AMH: Yes there is a vast right wing conspiracy. SidB6A must read piece that looks at the Koch brothers control and funding of the tea party and right wing.http://www.nowyorkenconlirep2rtin08130/100830fa fpct maysl2pitatIbie=true#IxzzoxQuvTcbTA REPORTER AT 1.ARGECOVERT OPERATIONSThe billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.by Jane Mayetmo(.s..David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred milliondollars to right-wing causes.On May 17th a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall jovial-looking billionaire tOok thestage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre and David H. Koch was being celebrated for hisgenerosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming seasonand had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs Blaine Trumpin a peach-colored gown and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg in emerald green. Kennedy's mother Jacqueline KennedyOnassis had been a patron of the ballet and coincidentally the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch hadbought in 1995 and then sold eleven years later for thirty-two million dollars having found it too small.The gala marked the social ascent of Koch who at the age of seventy has become one of the city's most prominentphilanthropists. In 2008 he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre buildingwhich now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History whose dinosaur wing isnamed for him. This spring after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art Kochpledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum perhaps the most coveted social prize inthe city and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center where after he donated more than forty milliondollars an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair Michelle Obama. Her officesaid that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it mighthave created an awkward tableau. In Washington Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealthattacks on the federal government and on the Obama Administration in particular.With his brother Charles who is seventy-four David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries a conglomerateheadquartered in Wichita. Kansas whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company hasgrown spectacularly since their father Fred died in 1967 and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries inAlaska Texas and Minnesota and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towelsDixie. cups Georgia-Pacific lumber Staimnaster carpet and Lycra among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largestprivate company in the country after Cargill and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch‚Äîwho yearsago bought out two other brothers‚Äîamong the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars isexceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes minimal social servicesfor the needy and much less oversight of industry‚Äîespecially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with thebrothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political EconomyResearch Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a reportidentifying the company as a "kingpin of climate science denial." The report showed that from 2005 to 2008 the Kochs vastlyoutdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change unclerwriting'a hugenetwork of foundations think tanks and political front groups. Indeed the brothers have funded opposition campaigns againstso many Obama Administration policies‚Äîfrom health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that in political circlestheir ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.In a statement Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report "distorts the environmental record of our companies." And. .David Koch in a recent admiring article about him in New York protested that the "radical press" had turned his family into"whipping boys" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis the founder of the Center forPublic Integrity a nonpartisan watchdog group said "The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who hasspent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking politicalmanipulation and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate and I've never seen anything like it. They are theStandard Oil of our times."few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation‚Äîan organization thatDavid Koch started in 2004‚Äîheld a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend a summit called Texas Defendingthe American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventureslie did not attend the summit and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by adanceperformance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable the organizer of the summitwarned that Administration officials "have a socialist visiOn for this country."Five hundred people attended the summit which served in part as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. Anadvertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. "Today the voices of average Americans arebeing drowned out by lobbyists and special interests" it said. "But you can do something about it." The pitch made no mentionof its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .Axelrod Obama's senior adviser said "What they don't say is that in part this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought toyou by a bunch of oil billionaires."In April 2009 Melissa Cohlmia a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party sayingthat Americans for Prosperity is "an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.".Later she issued a statement: "No funding has been provided by Koch companies the Koch foundations or Charles Koch orDavid Koch specifically to support the tea parties." David Koch told New York "I've never been to a tea-party event. No onerepresenting the tea party has ever even approached me."At the lectern in Austin however Venable‚Äîa longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans forProsperity and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994‚Äîspoke less warily: "We love what the TeaParties are doing because that's how we're going to take back America!" she declared as the crowd cheered. In a subsequentinterview she described herself as an early member of the movement joking "I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!"She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help "educate" Tea Party activists on policy details and to givethem "next-step training" after their rallies so that their political energy could be channelled "more effectively." And she notedthat Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs."They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them and I'm very appreciative Ofwhat they do."Venable honored several Tea Party "citizen leaders" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave itsBlogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th West writing on her site described Obama asthe "cokehead in chief." In an online thread West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of "demonicpossession (aka schizophrenia etc.)." The summit featured several paid speakers including Janine Turner the actress bestknown for her role on the television series "Northern Exposure." She declared "They don't want our children to know abouttheir rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!"During a catered lunch Venable introduced Ted Cruz a former solicitor general of Texas who told the crowd that Obamawas "the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda‚Äî"the governmenttaking over our economy and our lives." Countering Obama Cruz proclaimed was the epic fight of our generation!" As thecrowd rose to its feet and cheered he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: "Victory or death!"Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before thefirst Tax Day protests in April 2009 Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters "Tea Party TalkingPoints." The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for"Taxpayer Tea Party Registration" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. TheNorth Carolina branch recently launched a "Tea Party Finder" Web site advertised as "a hub for all the Tea Parties in NorthCarolina."The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to"educate" fund and organize Tea Party protesters they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. BruceBartlett a conservative economist and a historian who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis a Dallas-basedthink tank that the Kochs fund said "The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and noIndians. There haven't been any actual people like voters who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has beentrying to create a movement." With the emergence of the Tea Party he said "everyone suddenly sees that for the first time thereare Indians out there‚Äîpeople who can provide real ideological power." The Kochs he said are "trying to shape and control andchannel the populist uprising into their own policies."-A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party "TheKoch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes and thefrogs come out of the mud‚Äîand they're our candidates!"The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead a prominent New York public-relationsexecutive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki the former governor of New York and MortimerZuckerman the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki a Republican who received campaign donations from David Kochcalled him "a patriot who cares deeply about his country." Zuckerman praised David's "gentle decency" and the "range of hispublic interests."The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities "To call them under the radar is anunderstatement. They are underground!" Another former Koch adviser said "They're smart. This right-wing redneck stuffworks for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves." Rob Stein a Democratic politicalstrategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances said that the Kochs are "at the epicenter of the anti-Obamamovement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill ‚Ä¢Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism."ddly enough the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutchprinter who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T. where he earned a degree in chemicalengineering. In 1927 he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but according to family loreAmerica's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home Kochfound work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regimeset up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time however Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch wasdeeply affected by the experience and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his companyRock Island Oil & Refining in Wichita he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had beendestroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega a former friend of Charles Koch recalled "As the Soviets became astronger military power Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot."In 1958 Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society the arch-conservative group known inpart for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside Koch claimed that the Communists haveinfiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties." He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communistsin Italy and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. "The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to takeover America" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities where they would foment "a vicious racewar." In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot Koch predicted that Communists would"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist unknown to the rest of us."Koch married Mary Robinson the daughter of a Missouri physician and they had four sons: Freddie Charles and twinsDavid and William. John Damgard the president of the Futures Industry Association was David's schoolmate and friend. Herecalled that Fred Koch was "a real John Wayne type." Koch emphasized rugged pursuits taking his sons big-game hunting inAfrica and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound acrossfrom Wichita's country club; in the summer the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool but they were not allowedto join them. "By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age my father did me a big favor although it didn't seem like a favorback then" Charles has written. "By the time I was eight he made sure work occupied most of my spare time." David Kochrecalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. "He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrongwith government" he told Brian Doherty an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason and the author of "Radicals forCapitalism" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. "It's something I grew up with‚Äîa fundamental point of view that biggovernment was bad and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good."David attended Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and Charles was sent to military school. Charles David and Williamall earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater M.I.T. and later joined the family company. Charles eventuallyassumed control with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard andstudied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him and punished him financially.(Freddie through a spokesperson denied this:)In 1967 after Fred Koch died of a heart attack Charles renamed the business Koch Industries in honor of his father. FredKoch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni atDeerfield where after pledging twenty-five million dollars he was made the school's sole "lifetime trustee." He said "Youmight ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well let me tell you a story. It all started whenI was alittle boy. One day my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them forten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well this went on day after day week after week month after monthyear after year until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!"David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics but they did not share all his views according todiZerega who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore inWichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion to participate in an informal political-discussion group. "It waspretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit" diZerega recalled.DiZerega who has lost touch with Charles eventually abandOned right-wing views and became a political-scienceprofessor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy which set him on the path to academia; Charles isone of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a waywardintellectual trajectory transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government andseeing its expansion beginning with the New Deal as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay posted on Beliefnet diZeregawrites "As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards."Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-marketideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek the author of "The Road toSerfdom" (1944) which argued that centralized government planning led inexorably to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief inunfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately Tea Party supportershave championed his work. In June the talk-radio host Glenn Beck who has supported the Tea Party rebellion promoted "TheRoad to Serfdom" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of theKochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore Beck said without explanation "I want to thank Charles Koch for thisinformation." Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker Robert LeFevre who favored the abolition of the statebut didn't like the label "anarchist"; he called himself an "autarchist." LeFevre liked to say that "government is a diseasemasquerading as its own cure." In 1956 he opened an institution called the Freedom School in Colorado Springs. BrianDoherty of Reason told me that "LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart" and that the school was "a tinyworld of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake." According to diZerega Charles supported the schoolfinancially and even gave him money to take classes there.Throughout the seventies Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980 William with assistance fromFreddie attempted to take over the company from Charles who they felt had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation thecompany's board which answered to Charles fired William. ("Charles runs it all with an iron hand" Bruce Bartlett theeconomist told me.) Lawsuits were filed with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remainedand litigation continued for seventeen more years with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990 they walked pastone another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco which has no income tax.He bought historic estates in France. Austria and elsewhere filling them with art antiques opera scores and literarymanuscripts. William founded his own energy company Oxbow and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-fivemillion dollars to win the America's Cup in 1992.With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O. Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman who heads theinvestment-banking firm Evercore told me that the company's performance has been "beyond phenomenal." Charles remainedin Wichita with his wife and two children guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to NewYork City where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. Afinancial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me "Charles is the company. Charles runs it." David described byassociates as "affable" and "a bit of a lunk" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South ofFrance and bought a waterfront home in Southampton where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likenedto an "East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees." In 1996 he married Julia Flesher a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan andmore genial than that of Charles Brian Doherty who has interviewed both brothers couldn't think of a single issue on whichthe brothers disagreed.As their fortunes grew Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics inAmerica. Charles's goal as Doherty described it was to tear the government "out at the root." The brothers' first major publicstep came in 1979 when Charles persuaded David then thirty-nine to run for public office. They had become supporters of theLibertarian Party and were backing its Presidential candidate Ed Clark who was running against Ronald Reagan from theright. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations they contrived to place David on the ticket in the Vice-Presidentialslot; upon becoming a candidate he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket'sslogan was "The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You." In fact its primary source of funds was David Kochwho spent more than two million dollars on the effort.Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation thatlibertarians were getting ready to stage "a very big tea party" because people were "sick to death" of taxes. The LibertarianParty platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. as well as of federal regulatory agencies such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security minimum-wagelaws gun control and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution recreational drugsand suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley Jr. amore traditional conservative called the movement "Anarcho-Totalitarianism."That November the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand ofpolitics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. "It tends to be a nastycorrupting business" he told a reporter at the time. "I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas." According to Doherty'sbook the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely "actors playing out a script." A longtime confidant of the Kochstold Doherty that the brothers wanted to "supply the themes and words for the scripts." In order to alter the direction ofAmerica they had to "influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks."fter the 1980 election Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch familyfoundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations three of which they founded and several of whichthey direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns advocacy groups andlobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang of the liberal blog ThinkProgresshas called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate."Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe CharitableFoundation which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife along with two company employees and an accountant spentmore than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.Meanwhile since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately the company'spolitical-action committee KochPAC has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns more than eightyper cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010 Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in politicalcontributions as it has since 2006. In addition during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family membershave personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010 DavidKoch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association with a million-dollar donation.Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politicallyactive nonprofit groups.In recent decades members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. Inthe nineteen-eighties the Olin family which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate became known for fundingright-leaning thinking in academia particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife a descendant ofAndrew Mellon spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt a vice-president at theDemocratic-leaning Web site Media Matters said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual in its marshalling of corporate and personalfunds: "Their role in terms of financial commitments is staggering."Of course Democrats give money too. Their most prominent donor the financier George Soros runs a foundation theOpen Society Institute that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generousprivate contributions to various Democratic campaigns including Obama's. But Michael Vachon his spokesman argued thatSoros's giving is transparent and that "none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests." The Kochshave given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.Gus diZerega the former friend suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into arationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles "Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom."Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law charitablefoundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the NationalCommittee for Responsive Philanthropy a watchdog group described the Kochs' foundations as being self-servingconcluding "These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact theprofit margin of Koch Industries."The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest however funding organizations that aim to push thecountry in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice which files.lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies which underwrites libertarian academics; andthe Bill of Rights Institute which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by theKochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch hasacknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. "If we're going to give a lot of money we'll make darn sure they ‚Ä¢spend it in a way that goes along with our intent" he told Doherty. "And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things wedon't agree with we withdraw funding."he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills in many ways the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo thatLewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwarmovement had turned its anger on defense contractors such as Dow Chemical and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interestcrusade against corporations. Powell writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged American companies to fightback. The greatest threat to free enterprise he warned was not Communism or the New Left but rather "respectable elementsof society"‚Äîintellectuals journalists and scientists. To defeat them he wrote business leaders needed to wage a long-term‚Ä¢ unified campaign to change public opinion.Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. "To bring aboutsocial change" he told Doherty requires "a strategy" that is "vertically and horizontally integrated" spanning "from ideacreation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action." The projecthe admitted was extremely ambitious. "We have a radical philosophy" he said.In 1977 the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. According to the'Center for Public Integrity between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Catohas more than a hundred full-time employees and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by themainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it hasconsistently pushed for corporate tax cuts reductions in social services and laissez-faire environmental policies.When President Obama in a 2008 speech described the science on global warming as "beyond dispute" the Cato Institutetook out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts tostop global warming as expensive ineffective and unnecessary. Ed Crane the Cato Institute's founder and president told methat "global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy."Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year private e-mails of climatescientists at the University of East Anglia in England were mysteriously leaked and their exchanges appeared to suggest awillingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails wentpublic one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquirieshave since exonerated the researchers and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus onglobal warming. ‚Ä¢Nevertheless the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal moreAmericans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. TheKochs promote this statis	
"ic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fosteringsuch doubt.In a 2002 memo the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensusabout global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmentalreform he said was to question the science‚Äîa public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years toforestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism such as the Heritage Foundation whichhas argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""The brothers have given money to more obscure groups too such as the Independent Women's Forum which opposes thepresentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008 the group was run by NancyPfotenhauer a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary is on the group'sboard.Naomi Oreskes a professor of history and science studies at the University of California San Diego is the co-author of""Merchants of Doubt"" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion onscience. She noted that the Kochs as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines"" have ""a lot at stake."" She added""If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels a different group of people are going to be making money so we shouldn't besurprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it hasbeen he said the heating of the planet will be beneficial resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""TheEarth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food"" he said.n the mid-eighties the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University in Arlington Virginia to set up anotherthink tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-orientedideas‚Äîbridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch familyfoundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason much of which has gone to the MercatusCenter a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington"" Rob Stein the Democratic strategistsaid. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university and receives public funds"" Stein noted. ""Virginia ishosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbyingoperation in Washington. In addition he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation the president of theClaude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation and a director and co-founder with David Koch of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.Fink with his many titles has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted EdCrane the head of the Cato Institute as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at CatoCharles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles'smanagement philosophy which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success"" and trademarked under the nameMarket-Based Management or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with thecompetitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision virtueand talents knowledge processes decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he'sa genius. He's the emperor and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink by contrast has been far more embracing ofCharles's ideas. (Fink like the Kochs declined to. be interviewed.)At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the MercatusCenter's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual rawmaterials into policy ""products.""The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of"" and notedthat fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first byMercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles"" and that the MercatusCenter does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity a law professor at the University ofTexas who specializes in environmental issues told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A. andMercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center calledit ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to aneutral-sounding think tank"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""In 1997 for instance the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone a form of pollution caused in part by emissions from oilrefineries. Susan Dudley an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center criticized the proposed rule. TheE.P.A. she argued had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected thatif pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.In 1999 the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule the courtfound that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion thecourt ruled 2-1 that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the ConstitutionalAccountability Center a think tank revealed the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets on a Montanaranch that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment‚Äîa group funded by Koch familyfoundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.deas don't happen on their own"" Matt Kibbe the president of Freedom Works a Tea Party advocacy group told me.""Throughout history ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers after helping to create Cato and Mercatus concluded that thinktanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street and to attract thepublic's support. in 1984 David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The groupCitizens for a Sound Economy seemed like a grassroots movement but according to the Center for Public Integrity it wassponsored principally by the Kochs who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission Kibbe said ""was to takethese heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolentrevolutions--Saul _Minsky Gandhi Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example ofnonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas not candidates."" Within a few years thegroup had mobilized fifty paid field workers in twenty-six states to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charlesaccording to one participant were ""very controlling very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""Around this time the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989 the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigatedtheir business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oilfrom Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-onemillion dollars' worth of crude oil but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oilmeasurement is ""a very uncertain art.""To defend its reputation Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soonopened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations but it eventually disbanded withoutissuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personallives of committee staffers even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Battenthe counsel to the Senate committee said ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'.'By ‚Ä¢1993 when Bill Clinton became President Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind ofcorporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault onClinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy for instance running advertisements staging media events and targeting opponents.And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol‚Äîrallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts ofwavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman a former Democratic congressman from Wichita who supported the B.I.U. tax recalled""I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of'resources and effort‚Äîtheir employees too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it but I think I was probablytheir victim"" he said.The Kochs continued to disperse their money creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names and this madeit difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990 Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoffgroup Citizens for the Environment which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When thePittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""In 1997 another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millionsof dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source"" in order to evadecampaign-finance laws. A shell corporation Triad Management had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads intwenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit groupthe Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or inpart by Charles and David Koch of Wichita Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack adsmost of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas where Triad Management was especially activethe funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs when asked by reporters if they had given themoney refused to comment. In i998 however the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll hadbeen involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was thefirst time a major corporation used a cutout""‚Äîa front operation‚Äî""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child ofa company run amok.""uring the Clinton Administration the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties the JusticeDepartment filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spillswhich had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as twohundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine and agreed tospend five million dollars on environmental projects.In 1999 a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosionthat resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001 the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the finalmonths of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company forcovering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene a carcinogen from its refinery in Corpus Christi Texas. The companywas liable ‚Ä¢for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations includingthe falsification of documents and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann a career prosecutor who at the timeheaded the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases everbrought under the Clean Air Act."" He added ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arroganceand in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""During the 2000 election campaign Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidaciesof George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyedremarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill offeredenormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks but according to astudy by Media Matters their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since2000.In 2004 Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. Thegroup's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot in order to dilute Democratic support forJohn Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan politicalpurposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)That year internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Finkstarted a new group Americans for Prosperity and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who hadworked with Ralph Reed the evangelical leader and Republican activist co-founding Century Strategies a campaign-consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biographydescribes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an evengreater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics calledPhillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""Last year Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.Currently its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size the Kochs' political involvement hasbeen intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity in concert with the family's otherorganizations has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.In January 2008 Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss ofliberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives ata Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com took the lecternthanked David Koch and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office Americansfor Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released areport claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually the author wasforced to correct the report but not before Rush Limbaugh citing.the paper had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund"" andFox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen the vice-president for policy at Americans forProsperity is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity Walter Williams oftenguest-hosts for Limbaugh.)Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot Patients United Now which organized what Phillips has estimated to bemore than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; atanother protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protestsoutside the Capitol in March where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.Phillips was a featured speaker.Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation which is aimed at makingindustries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed with exaggeration that even back-yardbarbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar VanJones and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of ordinary workers who wouldbe hurt by environmentalists Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conferenceon climate change declaring ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthyfamilies . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""Grover Norquist who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington including representatives fromAmericans for Prosperity told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. TheRepublican leadership in Congress he said ""couldn't have clone it without August when people went out on the streets. Itdiscouraged deal-makers""‚ÄîRepublicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover theappearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollarweathervane"" Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong the Chamber of Commerce said 'We can work with the ObamaAdministration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is whatchanged it. Now that Obama is weak people are getting tough.""As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphantAmericans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working withthe Administration on health care or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude and Tea Party groupswere accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech Koch said ""Days like today bring to reality thevision of our board of directors when we started this organization five years ago."" He went on ""We envisioned a massmovement a state-based one but national in scope of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of lifestanding up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfullythe stirrings from California to Virginia and from Texas to Michigan show that more and more of our fellow-citizens arebeginning to see the same truths as we do."" .While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day more recently he has come close to doing sopraising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in governmentpower the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employeescompared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense ofimperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties andsince the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message hasevidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.Americans for Prosperity meanwhile has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before themidterm elections in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates it nonethelessplans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races staging rallies organizing door-to-door canvassing andrunning ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink interviewedby FrumForum.com this spring said ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now with the expansion ofgovernment spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on ""Itlooks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to getmore into the practical day-to-day issues of governing.""n 1991 David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As hewas recovering a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment settled down started afamily and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane andeveryone.else died‚Äîyeah you think 'My God the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've beenbusy ever since doing all the good work 1 can think of so He can have confidence in me.""Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer researchfocussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-Presbyterian Hospital a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research twenty million to Johns HopkinsUniversity and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In response to his generosity Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004 President Bush named him to the National CancerAdvisory Board which guides the National.Cancer Institute.Koch's corporate and political roles however may pose conflicts of interest. For example at the same time that DavidKoch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent theE.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde which the company produces in great quantities as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats and several major scientific studies have concludedthat formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings‚Äîincluding one published last year by the National Cancer Institute on‚Ä¢whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposedto higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel withinthe National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen and be strictlycontrolled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades however and KochIndustries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A. requiring it to defer new regulationsuntil more studies are completed.Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005 after it bought Georgia-Pacific the paper and wood-products company for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division and usesit to produce various wood products such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2billion pounds. Last December Traylor Champion Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs sent a formalletter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusionthat formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the NationalCancer Advisory Board or divest himself of company stock while his company was directly lobbying the government to keepformaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)James Fluff an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences a division of the N.I.H. toldme that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as towhether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""Harold Vannus the director of the National Cancer Institute knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering which heused to run. He said that at Sloan-Kettering ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing wewouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde Varmus said thathe was ""surprised.""he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History is a multimediaexploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance viewers are confrontedwith a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years which notes that it is far cooler now than itwas ten thousand years ago. Overhead the text reads ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" Themessage as amplified by the exhibit's Web site is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response toenvironmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE"" is it notedthat levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been and that they are projected to increasedramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible roleplayed by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says ""Duringthe period in which humans evolved Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmospherefluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climatechange in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short compact bodies"" or ""curved spines""so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees for instance argueS that""fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity"" and concludes ""Since we can't control Mother Nature let's figure outhow to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org is infuriated by theSmithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue"" he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted tobe seen as some sort of high-minded company associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.But the truth is the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to dealwith this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""Cristian Samper the museum's director said that the exhibit is not about climate change and described Koch as ""one of thebest donors we've had in my tenure here because he's very interested in the content but completely hands off."" He noted ""1.don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate whatDavid Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Partyand with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. RecentlyPresident ¬∞barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser inAustin he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case‚Äîwhich struck down lawsprohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns‚Äîhad made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups withharmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said ""They don't have to say who exactly Americans forProsperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""‚Äîor even he added ""a big oil company."""",0

"Cheryl Mills <Sunday December 6 2009 9:39 PMFwd: Charles Blow in NYT todayEF1December 5 2009Op-Ed ColumnistBlack in the Age of ObamaBy CHARLES M. BLOWA hundred and fifty years ago Charles Dickens opened "A Tale of Two Cities" with the now-famous phrase:"It was the best of times it was the worst of times. ..."Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks inAmerica. So far it's been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas ‚Äî one of the ascension of the firstblack president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racialtensions while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain let alone commiserate in it.Last year blacks dared to dream anew envisioning a future in which Obama's election would be the catalyst foran era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the election's afterglow has nearly faded the hysteria ofhope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways they'vegotten worse.The recession for one has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks.A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-pricedsubprime loans leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group withthe lowest homeownership rates.According to the most recent jobs data not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whitesthe gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rateover that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohortsthe rate grew by about twice that much.And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008 "food insecurity" forAmerican households had risen to record levels with black children being the most likely to experience thatfood insecurity.Things on the racial front are just as bad.We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protesterwith a racist poster can hijack a news cycle while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact raciallyoffensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the resultsof image searches of them.And it's not all words and images; it's actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2008hate crimes data released last week anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007 while the combined hatecrimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend which wouldinclude Obarna's ascension as a candidate anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent while those against theother racial groups have fallen 19 percent.This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup last summer 23 percent ofblacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half thatpercentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better.The racial animosity that Obama's election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect amongblacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24 Obama's approval rating among whites has droppedto 39 percent but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.Also this hasn't exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up foraccidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off hismouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beatRihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently the "personal failings" ofTiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year"Precious" features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the presidentfeels like a nice counterbalance.However the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama'senemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when theirvoices would have presumably held greater sway.This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important toAfrican-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he's losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. Inthe Nov. 9 Gallup poll the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting effortsto aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.According to my analysis even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day Obamawould still be president. To a large degree Obama was elected by white people some of whom were more ableto accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.In fact commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this monthresearchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his "trueessence." In some of the photos his skin had been lightened. In others it had been darkened. The result? Themore people identified him with the "whiter" images the more likely they were to have voted for him and viceversa.The Age of Obama so far at least seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as aWhite House gamesman. It's unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect but an Obama Backlash isincreasingly apparent. Meanwhile black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.Forwarded message",0

"THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACTAWARDING COMMITTEEECOWAS HEADQUATERSACCRA GHANAWEST AFRICA.I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmedthe Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee inecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana West Africa. In due respectandregard I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will bevery beneficial to both of usat the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in mydepartmentwe discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoicedamounting $35000000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.Wediscovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 ininternationalBank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence oncontractpayments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by meandmy partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successfulduringthe time of execution. As it may interest you to know I got your contactthrough business inquires from the chamber of commerce here in my countryas Iwas making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in thistransaction.Meanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund as a paymentofcontract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the requiredapproval and transfer this money to a foreign accounthas been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayedtoyou as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us andalsobenefit yourself in this great businessopportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my positioninthis country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreignaccountand would eventually raise an eyebrow on myside during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it willrequirea second party or fellow who will forward claim as thecontractor and also present a foreign account where the money would betranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after dueverification by designated board. I would not fail to inform you that thistransaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of thistransaction you would be entitlled to 30% as gratificationwhile 5% will besetaside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transferandalso telephone bills while 65% will be for me andmy partners.Please you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in serviceandintend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I willbemonitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in youraccountand ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharingaccordingto percentages.

" Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today. However I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the world today not being sure of your reaction. I am Jones Martin a Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese Businessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January 2003 and matured for termination in January 2005. On maturity the Japanese Businessman and the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A special arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with Japanese bank in New York the Oil Company and the businessman to terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name with an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they prepared and handed over to The banker. I was directly involved well paid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was withdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault delivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection. The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was delivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for the storage secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys were all handed over to me. Mr. Takashi the Florida businessman was planning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when the unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap a natural disaster which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was lost.Since last December the diplomatic storage manager has been calling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. Since then I have been finding any reliable person to collect these consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came across your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been well organized 100% safe legal and should be kept very confidential. Signify your interest by getting back to me via my email as soon as possible.

"I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S/P member who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist andother places before she joined us in September. She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on ForeignRelations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.By EMILY PARKERIn 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant homesurrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded todiscuss why he believes that literature can change the world.Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory‚Äîand not just for a talented and prolific author. His work isperhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politicsor who claim that they have "no time" for fiction.In a New Republic essay in 2001 Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature "an important place in the lifeof nations." He wrote 'Without it the critical mind which is the real engine of historical change and the bestprotector of liberty would suffer an irreparable loss."Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the valueof individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes but I would argue that heis among the most successful.Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.A case in point is "Conversation in the Cathedral" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescuefirst from a fire. The novel is set in Peru in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s whichis when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe howdictatorships impregnate "every act of life."To demonstrate this Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The bookopens with a grim landscape of "uneven and faded buildings" and describes "dull and defeated eyes at thetables of Zela bar hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer." The narrative which rapidly jumps frompast to present describes a stalled confused world. You don't know who to trust.Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in "The Feast of the Goat" which explicitly details the horrors ofthe Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women andso we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. "Thewoman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship" Mr. Vargas Llosa told me.For some Mr. Vargas Llosa's victory will be controversial because of his political background and hisoutspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990 losing to Alberto Fujimori. During thecampaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy free trade and privateproperty. He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq which he saw as necessary toending what he called the "monstrous dictatorship" of Saddam Hussein.Mr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or ashe told me in Lima: 'Through writing one can change history."Not all of his work is dark. "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter" is punctuated with humor and 'The Bad Girl" aboutone man's world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is aperceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience.As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature "Nothing better protects a human being againstthe stupidity of prejudice racism religious or political sectarianism and exclusivist nationalism than this truththat invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal."Ms. Parker is an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",0

But please consider this letter asa request from somebody in dare of assistance.Firstly I must introduce myself I am lt. Col.

I am presently in the republic of SouthAfrica as an asylum seeker.I got your contact address from a business directory inJohannesburg chamber of commerce and industry and aftergoing through your profileI decided to solicit for yourassistance to transfer the sum of US$ 25million (Twenty-fiveMillion United States Dollars) into your company orpersonal account for investment purposes outside Africa.Before his death late president kabila was aware thatrebels will not leave any stone unturned in their attemptto remove him from government hence he started looting thecountrys treasure.In May 2000 he directed me to oversee the movement of acertain box marked diplomatic documents into Zimbabwe butI decided to divert the box into the republic of SouthAfrica where I found out that the box was actuallycontaining the sum of US$ 25 million (Twenty-five millionunited states dollars). I therefore deposited the boxcontaining the fund into a security and finance company here inJohannesburg. I have been in hiding since then but with therecent death of president Kabila I therefore decided totransfer this money out of Africa for investment.>From the above you will understand that my life and thatof my children depends on the fund as such I will begrateful if you can assist me. I am now living in therepublic of South Africa as a political asylum seeker withmy family and the financial rules and regulations of SouthAfrica do not permit me financial right to such huge amountof money.In view of this I cannot invest this fund in South Africahence I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total sum foryour assistance while 10% will be set aside for unforeseenexpenses and 70% will be for me and my family's investmentin your country with your assistance.Please call me on the above telephone or emailme to signify your interest in this transaction.Thanks and God bless you for your anticipated co-operation.Lt.Col .

"HelloI am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As you read this don't feel sorry for me because it is the destiny of everyman to die someday. I am Jaron Abbas an Israeli by birth and a business merchant based in Scotland. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my trade. Though I am very well to do I was never open handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more to life than just prosperity.I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is imminent I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far I have been able to reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.The last of my belonging which no one knows of is the huge deposit of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe keeping company abroad which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.deJaron Abbas",1

"" With due respect trust and humanity I write to you this proposal which I believe would be of great interest to you. I am Mrs Awa Keita the wife of late EL-MUSTAPHA KEITA of blessed memory. Before my husband was killed by forces loyal to MAJOR JOHNNY PAUL KOROMA he was the Director-General of Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation (GDMC) of Sierra-Leone. My husband targeted by the rebel forces in the course of the revolution. Two days before his death he managed to sneak a written message to us explaining his condition and concerning one trunk box of valuables containing money and gold which he deposited with a private Security & Finance Company in Abidjan Cote d'Iviore. He instructed me to take our two children(Ibrahim and Zinat) and move out of Sierra-Leone immediately to Abidjan Cote d'Iviore before the Peace Keeping Forces of the Economic Community of West African States(ECOMOG) monitoring team intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by the rebels which was the order of the day. Eventually it resulted into full war. I became a widow overnight; helpless situation without partner. At that moment of calamity every person was running for his/her life. In the content of the deed he signed with the Security Company he used the name of his son Master Ibrahim Keita as the next of kin. The real content of the box were not disclosed to the Security Company due to security reasons. Now as a refugee we have very limited financial rights here we intend to leave this country immediately with the whole money for investment in your country because of the stable situation and mostly for the future benefits of my children. We have since applied for political asylum. The cash involved inside in the box is US$ 10.5 Million ( Ten million and five hundred thousand united state dollars). I want you to assist us to claim the box from the Security Company as the new beneficiary so that the change ownership of the documents covering this consignment/box will be legally effected to your name as to enable you have this money deposited in a local account here in Abidjan in your name for the easier transfer of this money in to your oversaes bank account. We also source for good investment so that we can invest the money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding investment and good relationship with you. Concerning the money we are prepared to offer you a reasonable percentage of 20% of the total sum proceeds. Meanwhile 5% has been mapped out for any expenses you may incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for my family. For the interest of this business do not hesitate to contact us with the above email addresss immediately you receive this message for more information to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding all our arrangements. No other person knows about this money apart from my children and I. We await your most urgent response. Thanks for your co-operation and God bless you.

"I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I.must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a greatsuccess so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs lastweek the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).Needless to say the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days 30000 pple visited. Lines are longand pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.-the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarinis met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes fromthe ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo'swhen you and President come on the screen.- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it andthe bison stuffed animals - who knew?Anyway thght u'd enjoy the quick report.

"I read the Roger Cohen piece and agree that it is v smart. And I've been thinking about the need for a headline/bumpersticker for the speech. How about "A New American Century"? We cd take on the critics directly and right up front andmake the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro but wd need to be pulled together differently).1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that requirebringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is theonly option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing aprofile - it resonated v well w/ landler.)2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be broughttogether that do not trust each other we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nationsare sitting around the table contemplating a common problem someone has to step forward and take responsibility formobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that both because of ourhistory and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in aworld of global problems we are the most global nation with the greatest global reach resources and connections.3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity b/c of our native confidenceoptimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda focusing ondevelopment as well as traditional national security issues and mobilizing business and civil society as well asgovernments. This is our time.The speech would then go on as it does now to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solvingproblems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architectureof cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.AM",0

"sbwhoeorSunday September 19 2010 11:18 PMH: Richard Medley has sent this around in his private newsletter. SidUS Election And The FedWelcome To The New (Old) WorldSeptember 19 2010One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much moreconservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officialson both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers).But it's not just spending and taxes important as they are it's also implementation of Reg Reform andHealth Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details.Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and as you know we LOVEsnarkiness) two things should not be lost:1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health carelegislation Congress pushed through.All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over theHouse. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate they will be able to gain effective control ofspending taxes and large scale administrative reforms.Let's start with spending:The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As wewrote nearly a week ago House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to usthat they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This willbe one of the top Republican priorities.Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However even in the unlikely event the Republicans donot take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last timemoney was formally appropriated).Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October the Congress hasto pass a "continuing resolution" that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made(the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuingresolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority).Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the newCongress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session butthat would be cutting it close and too cute.Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will bedominated by fiscal conservatives Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it moremoderate but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it andtake the hit.In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan toslow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills.The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rulesrequires staff increases staff reg writing etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levelsyou freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process.Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidalwave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting tosee one of those).The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws willaccomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done and potentially give the courts time to strikedown parts of the health care bill now under appeal.THE SENATEWhile everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't) the attention should be onwhat the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails.The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got aglimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the healthcare public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges.The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending the debt taxes andregulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easierTake a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn intooffice).While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats all of them are generally consideredmore conservative than their predecessors:1. ck (CO) - likely winner2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner6. Portman (OH) -likely winner7. Coats (IN) - likely winner8. Paul (KY) - likely winner9. Miller (AK) - likely winner10. Lee (UT) - likely winner11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP)14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossupThere are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA WI WA and CT). These racescontinue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer.These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate:1. DeMint (SC)2. Coburn (OK)3. Inhofe (OK)4. McConnell (KY)5. Kyl (AZ)6. McCain (AZ)7. Thune (SD)8. Crapo (ID)9. Vitter (LA)10. Burr (NC)One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace and Republicans operated efficiently as aminority party with only 41 votes total. In January there will be at least 22 new and existing serious roadblocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for clotureimpossible on spending bills.Welcome to the new reality.",0

"Good DayWith warm heart I offer my friendship and my greetings and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.My name is Mr.Mako Okere the first son of Iko Okereone of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict I decided to contact you through email after searching for contacts via the internet as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. HoweverI apologize if this is not acceptable to you.The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the the land and political problems in Zimbabwe as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers and his desire to hold on to power for life my father forsaw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in major companies. We then went to Johannesburg South Africa to deposit the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million Five Hundred thousand US dollars) in a private security company. This money was deposited with this Private Security company for safety and security reasons and was to be used for the purchase of land new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana and Swaziland.President Mugabe's support for the violent imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society led to the murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while but when the danger became unbearable and I survived two murder attempts I fled Zimbabwe to South Africa where I was arrested and detained for eight(8 good month)in jail.I fled south Africa for The Netherlands with the help of the present prison command chief officer in Charge(P.C.C.O)I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum is because the security company from South Africa has a branch here and they have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg here. I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial ransaction this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner whose account this money can be transferred ence this proposal to you.You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future and in your hands as a result of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me all I want you to do for me is to assist with the arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office here in The Netherlands as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg South Afri! ca to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you representing me.For your assistance I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want please to notify me in your reply.I have also set aside 1%($14500000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction and 4% ($58000000) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account then 85%will be left in the account here for me.Please I want you to maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.I look forward to your reply and co-operation and I thank you inadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.Thanks and God bless.SincerelyMako Okere",1

"Dear SIRI am Mr. John Coleman and my sister is Miss Rose Coleman we are thehildren of late Chief Paul Coleman from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of twenty one Million Dollars ($21000.000.00) now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as money although my father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.Source of the money:My late father Chief Paul Coleman  a native of Mende District in the Northerh province of Sierra Leone was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND NETHERLAND with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aidof U.N evacuation team.During the war in my country and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.As a result of my father's death  and with the news of my uncle's involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relationwe are nowlike refugees and orphans.Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm To this effect I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security Firm as our beneficiary2. to transfer this money (USD$21M) in your name to your country3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on ourbehalf in your country and you our Adviser/ ManagerFor your assistance I have agreed with my younger sister that 15% of the total amount will be for your effort and another 5 % to cover all the expenses that may incur during the business transaction Last I urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one knows our where about.Please as you show your willingness Forward to us your full name address and Tel/ Fax numbers to me via my private email address as indicated bellow(johnc7g@netscape.net) this is for security reasons as i will only be accessing my private email earnestly awaiting your response.Thanks.May God bless you as you assist us.Mr. JOHN COLEMAN.",1

"SirAccept my apologies for writing to you in this mode for it might be of inconvenience to you but due to my quest for an honest and reliable international assistance concerning a business here in my country Nigeria I have no other option than to go this length. I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC. I am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500000.00 (forty two million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor. As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business.To commence this transaction I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number fax number full name & address and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made. Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness.I look forward to receiving your prompt response.Best regards MOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D)",1

"How Come we havent?This is what we are up against.BetrayedThey said we were there to save Afghanistan's women. So howcome we haven't?BY VALERIE M. HUDSON PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10 2010One day in November 2009 in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah a group of Afghan widows and divorcees metwith Patricia who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID). All the women were in their 20s 30s and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recentlynone of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills could neither read nor write and were at risk ofbeing killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that before the program -- which focused on tailoring andbasic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger.COMMENTS (22) SHARE:TwitterRedditBuzzEMore...As Patricia prepared to leave the women fluttered around her like moths touching her sleeves and speaking all at once.'What are they saying?" Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. "They are telling you to go back to yourcountry and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will quiteliterally die if the Taliban return" she said.In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities Brigham Young a student asked Gen. David Petraeuswhether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate "reformed"Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave.Carefully avoiding the word "women" the general assured the questioning student that only "moderate" Taliban would beeligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of "moderate" which clearly depends on where you sit:If you sit in a burqa there is no such thing as a "moderate" Taliban.Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistan's women once the "moderate"Taliban come back but it's likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- anduntil we've done more to protect it we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan.In 2001 George W. Bush's administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school andof Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A fewmonths after the invasion in his 2002 State of the Union address Bush announced "The last time we met in thischamber the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes forbidden from working or going toschool. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government."The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. Theystrong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are nottreated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras and USAID ripped apage from Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women.But the current administration despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Women's Issues appearsto be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustainedrhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Sincethen and especially since last year's Afghan election those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared.Many of the fine actions are gone too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras intoincluding women in 2010? Forget it.It's not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stagesof the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogue's gallery of kleptocrats human rightsabusers and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusingsenior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power.In the meantime women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But theirsuffering is real as Afghanistan's poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistanstill makes the world's top three list nine years after the U.S. invasion resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. Inthe countryside Taliban zealots spray acid into girls' faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in thefirst place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women 87 percent of Afghan women reportbeing beaten on a regular basis.In July of last year the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stingingofficial condemnation of the Karzai administration's abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded "Thecurrent reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course ofseeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them." Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who --before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband who had battled for redress was assassinatedsoon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain deathwhile their murderers face 100 percent impunity.For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government the issue of gender equalitywas always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through thedeployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Women's Affairs.Indeed just before his recent "election" Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measuresdesigned to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster.Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives Karzaisuccessfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits women's rights to inherit divorce or haveguardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors.It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit women's access towork education and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for "legitimate" purposes. EvenKarzai's own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad justwait until the Americans leave.This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women but boys and men. In Afghanistanbecause women are rarely able to leave the house very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount offinancial responsibility something that limits their prospects as well.Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March "The subjugation of women is athreat to the national security of the United States." On a geopolitical level Valerie's research has found that states withhigher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed violence against women is a betterpredictor of bellicosity than level of democracy level of wealth or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study Valeriealong with Brad Thayer also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development ofIslamic suicide terrorism.So given the desperate need of Afghanistan's women and the serious consequences worldwide why aren't we doingmore to help? One reason is the fallacious notion common among coalition members that Afghan "culture" does notallow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from onecoalition representative who prefers to remain anonymous: 'There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will onlyalienate them [Afghans]." Of course "them" here refers only to men.But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago Afghanwomen were attending universities teaching working as doctors nurses and professors. Far from being a black hole ofgender apartheid Afghanistan though impoverished was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors.Furthermore many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009 hundreds of Afghan men and womenbravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzai's support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americansassume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters they are wrong.Another more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military lifedespite increasing female recruitment and even "female engagement teams" remains a bastion of masculinity with littlesensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike immured as they are in an almostexclusively male world the complete absence of women from Afghanistan's streets and villages elicited no comment fromthe Marines who surrounded Pat though she as a woman noticed it immediately.And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West not onlydamages prospects for gender equality but by extension Western interests. As one young well-educated 24-year-oldAfghan male pointed out "Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploitwomen in ways that we can't even imagine. Do you call that progress?" Added another Afghan USAID programmerworking in Gardez a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls "It would be better for the coalition if they could figureout a way to limit this kind of material."We can do better -- much better.The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protectingwomen's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security.The military should spend less time courting "moderate" Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders howgender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families lower maternaland child death rates poverty alleviation and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in allgovernance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming "peace jirga" that will include the Taliban.Indeed let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes a full 50 percent.Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer U.S. ambassador at large for global women'sissues noted last summer speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan "There is only one minister in the cabinet andshe is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor inBamiyan." Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingentupon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government.Better yet the coalition needs to support "regime change" through the building of democratic institutions that will groom amoderate educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghanpopulation is under the age of 25 which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given achance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle if they find themselves without jobs unable tomarry and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female.We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination ofDiscrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women peace andsecurity. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly has not) and that means that ithas committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equalityenshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights andfundamental freedoms as men having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women takingmeasures to eliminate sexist discrimination and lastly submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisorygroup of international experts the CEDAW Committee to ensure transparency on what measures the country has takento implement the treaty's provisions.Unanimously adopted in 2000 UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate andunique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as activeagents in peace and security.Needless to say women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men and indeed with the passing ofthe Shiite family law many are worse off than they were before.To change this the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistanand the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existencenot fit for animals.We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off(Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record women around the world should haveno faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality andsecurity on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being in the end is not more than peripherally related to theissue of peace. As we have seen this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan arethe right ones: "Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms but also in terms of social politicaland economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights."American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women cancontinue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women you break faithwith American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place.Save bio when you subscribe to FP.Majid Saeedi/Getty Image",0

"FROM THE DESK OF DR YUSUF SAMI.BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGERFOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO.Dear friend I am the manager of bill and exchange at FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)I am writing following the impressive information about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm in your country. He assured me of your capability and releability to champion thisbusiness opportunity.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on Monday31 July 2000in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unlesssomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon thisdiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into thebank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such moneyremained unclaimed after four years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 5% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locationwherein the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for more explanations.Yours faithfullyDR YUSUF SAMI._________________________________________________________________Testez Windows Live Mail Beta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/",1

There is an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again but all this came to light after an internal auditing that I conducted by going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out&nbsp;immediately it would be forfeited for no reason.The owner of this account is MR SMITH B. ANDREAS a foreigner and a miner at Kruger gold co a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to ! me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.<BR><BR>I&nbsp; am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account was MR SMITH B. ANDREAS. We will sign an agreement but&nbsp;I assure you that it is real and a genuine business. Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone number and a fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement&nbsp;together so that&nbsp;we can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of our choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal sharing and other investments. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account and&nbsp; a foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.&nbsp;I have a correct information of this account which I will give to you later if you are able and willing to handle such an amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need a trustworthy person in this business because I donÔøΩt want to make a mistake I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the&nbsp;office I can transfer this money to any foreign reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business you will be given 30% of the total amount 60% will be for me and meanwhile 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>If my proposal is acceptable to you and you are willing to help me please&nbsp;let me know so that you will enable me to&nbsp; transfer the&nbsp;fund without any further delay or If there is anything beyond your understanding your welcome to e-mail or fax me on the number written above because time is of essence.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>I will hang-on until I hear&nbsp;from you soon.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Yours Faithfully<BR><BR>MR.

Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking my agitation is real and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves.

We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad that will stand as the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion since we are existing as refugees here.

" Dear One in Christ Good day I am sorry to take your time and to disturb you. I am Mrs Susan Thompson from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Eric Thompson who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before he died in the year 2001after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter (Lilian) who later died in a motor accident. Before the untimely death of my husbandwe were both born again Christians. Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$4.8 M )(FourMillionEight hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. Presentlythis money is still with the bank. RecentlyFollowing my ill health my Doctor told me that I may not last for the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Christain organization (Church) or individual beleiverthat will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct hereinaccording to the desire of my latehusband before his death. I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities likeOrphanages Christain schools and Churches for propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed is the hand that giveth". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the members of your Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Therefore Ibelieved that you shall posess the capability andreliability to champion this opportunity with me.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 14million US dollars (Fourteen million US dollars) inan account that belongs to one of our foreigncustomers who died along with his entire family inDecember2002 in a plane crash. Since we got the urglyinformation about his death we have been expectinghis next of Kin to come over and claim his moneybecause we can not release it unless somebody appliesfor it as next of Kin or relation to the deceased asindicated in our banking and financial policies butunfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kinor relation died along side with him in the accidentleaving no body behind to claim the money.It istherefore upon this discovery that I and otherofficials in my department now decided to makethis business proposal to you and release the money toyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased forsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody iscoming for it and we dont want this money to go intothe Bank treasury as unclaimed bills. The Banking lawand guideline here stipulates that if such moneyremained unclaimed after five years the money will betransferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in thisbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customerwas a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as nextof kin to the deceased family.We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you asforeign partner in respect to the provision of aforeign account 5% will be set aside for expensesincurred during this transaction and 75 % would be forme and my colleagues. Thereafter I and my colleagueswill visit your country for disbursement according tothe percentages indicated.To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to youas arranged above you must apply first to the Bank asthe relation or next of kin to the deceased indicatingyour private telephone and fax numbers for easy andeffective communication and location wherethe money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by faxor e-mail the text of the application.

"It's quite possibly the best thing written about you as SecState. We're getting it around to friends & family along withPeople op-ed and NYT Mag q&a - was a great weekend in terms of positive press.It's 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is?By David RothkopfWashington PostSunday August 23 2009When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton we're missing the forest for the pantsuits.Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nation's top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessorThomas Jefferson who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America --but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office the former first lady erstwhile presidentialcandidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods looks outtakes and (of course)relationship with her husband than for well her work revamping the nation's foreign policy.Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all-Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clinton's handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown whiledepicting herself as a Clinton supporter has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clinton'sweight and hair while her "defense" of Hillary in her essay "Obama's Other Wife" was as sexist as the title suggests.Indeed sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom as seen most recently in the posturingoutrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamousquestion regarding her husband's views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest whether the New York Timeswhich covered Clinton's first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House or TheWashington Post where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer ofchoice for the secretary of state.Amid all the distractions what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes inU.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W.Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview.The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalizedState Department one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite thepessimists who invoked the "team of rivals" cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get alongHillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop spine stiffener when it comes totough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. Recognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White Houseshe is instead tackling the tough questions that since the end of the Cold War have kept America's leaders awake allnight.In these early days of the new administration it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways inwhich her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficultpersonnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of alladministrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy --more assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obama's centrality amplifies the importance ofhis closest White House staffers while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke (onAfghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clinton'srole.Given the challenges involved it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day-to-day hand insome of the nation's most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama national security adviser Jim Jones VicePresident Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq Afghanistan and other inherited problemsof the recent past Clinton's State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- inparticular how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: Itrecognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obama's vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of theMiddle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past.Which nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China for example and Russia --are rivals as well? How must America's alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? How do we engage with roguestates and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? How dowe move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstateplayers and once-disenfranchised peoples?In searching for answers Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recentspeech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York where she revealed stark differences between the newadministration's worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include "partnership" and"engagement" and "common interests." Clearly Madeleine Albright's "indispensable nation" has recognized theindispensability of collaborating with others.Who those "others" are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. "We will put" Clinton said"special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China India Russia and Brazil as well as TurkeyIndonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda." This is the death knell for the G-8 as thehead table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor tothe G-8 will be the G-20 or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waningdays of the Bush era that administration viewed the world through a different lens a perception that evolved from atraditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the world's sole superpower.Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this yearand will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in November. Clinton has made trips toChina and India and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africaand the Middle East reaching out to women and the Islamic world.On many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emergingpowers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result we've seen a new American willingness to play down olddifferences whether with Russia on a missile shield or as Clinton showed on her China trip with Beijing on humanrights.At the center of Clinton's brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter the former dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School ofPublic and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department Slaughter elaborated on the ideasin Clinton's speech. "We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table but also building networkscoalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems" she told me."To do that" Slaughter continued "our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to communityorganizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind ofdiplomacy."A new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross one of the leaders of Obama'stechnology policy team to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. His mission isto harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networkshave played starring roles in recent incidents from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whetherthrough a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money forPakistani refugees in the Swat Valley technology has been deployed to reach new audiences.Of course you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources too. The secretary hasbrought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in FoggyBottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities suchas Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for women's issues Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreachworldwide and Todd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate.Even just a few months in it's clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew Slaughter and theacting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the newQuadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review an initiative modeled on the Pentagon's strategic assessments anddesigned to review State's priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the worldnotably with China. Clinton made women's issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa where she stressedthat "the social political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent thatundermines progress and prosperity."Clinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs Internationalvice chairman Robert Hormats a respected veteran of four administrations to handle economic issues at the StateDepartment as well as Judith McHale former chief executive of Discovery Communications to run public diplomacy. Inthe same vein she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to India's privatesector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping theself-interests of the business community. As with any new administration there have been inevitable problems. The oldcampaign teams -- Clinton's and Obama's -- still eye each other warily but this feeling is gradually fading. And by mostaccounts the administration's national security team has come together successfully with Clinton developing strongrelationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy Jim Steinberg hasrenewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the two of them working with Obamacampaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert have formed what one State Departmentseventh-floor dweller called "a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking." Henry Kissinger mayhave overstated matters when he said this is the best White House-State relationship in recent memory but it's not badwhile the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades.At the heart of things though is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administration's talk ofinternational partnerships that may be the most critical partnership of all.So far according to multiple high-level officials at State and the White House the two seem aligned in their views. Inaddition they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson onforeign policy as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoedhis points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattlingthe continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo the secretary of state hasspoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea.It is still early and a president's foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to theunexpected whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention orreluctant bureaucracies and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow as the self-congratulatory "smart power" alreadydoes to me.Nevertheless there is evidence that seven months into the job Obama's unlikely secretary of state is supporting andaugmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obama's "other wife" not as Bill Clinton's wife not even as a celebrity or as aformer presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of "Superclass:The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making" and "Running the World: The Inside Story of the NSC and theArchitects of American Power."

"" Alternative Email:judeigbo@juno.com Sir Compliment of the day and how is life general with you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and crave your indulgence to make this project request for a joint business transaction which I hope will not come to you as a surprise hence I plead for your pardon. I am Mike Igbo the manager of headquarter first bank of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and confidential business proposal for you. On June 6 1997 an Australian oil consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at US$25000 000. 00(Twenty-Five Million US Dollars) in my branch. On maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Peter Bush died from an automobile accident. On further investigation it was clear that he died without making a will. All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum US$25000000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian banking law after five years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government. If the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it. This is the situation and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiaryext of kin. This is simple. All you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money will then be transferred into the account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with here and there. There is no risk involved. I am using my position and connection in the bank here to do all the document work for the transaction. We shall employ the services of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all necessary documents and letter of administration in your favor for the transfer. This transaction is risk free guaranteed. If you are interested please reply immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction could be most profitable for both of us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not interested because if you do it will take me out of seat. I am awaiting your urgent reply. Best regards Mike Igbo.__________________________________Do you Yahoo!?New Yahoo! Photos - easier uploading and sharing.http://photos.yahoo.com/"",1

"Hillary: This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election. Its author is a right-wingRepublican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological andpartisan undercurrent of the piece especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather thanthe administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is noreason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern ofthe past is that the deficit the talisman of Hoover Republicans moves only partisan Republicans and that Democratsascend if the economy is progressing its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universalimpact. That is not happening now. This analysis therefore may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VAdon't show up in the email but they are described. SidReturn to the ArticleNovember 13 2009Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?By Sean TrendeJohn Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set inVirginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner who runs a moderate campaign that appeals toupper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters and manages to put together a winning coalition that ifimitated in other states might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner'scoalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarilysuccessful one for Democrats breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996 and ultimately enabling the electionof the most liberal President in American History last year.Given this background it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come inVirginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote ‚Äî the highest percentage (thoughnot the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins and theGOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse ‚Äî five Democrats won their Assemblyraces by fewer than 1000 votes.There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election it's silly to argue that the GOP brand istoo damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin ‚Äî that their weaknessamong Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining theirRepublican voting habits ‚Äî puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor inelections.But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections they do provide snapshots ofthe mood of the electorate and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democraticcoalition building it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:Culturally conservative hawkish and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They beganbreaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s ‚Äî their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions blacks andliberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities liberalsurban voters and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South who still preferred amoderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used acombination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovationfor Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County NY Orange County CA and Fairfax County VA had fueled the rise of theRepublican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win byeight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal he probably would have won by more.Clinton intuited that suburban voters are generally speaking culturally cosmopolitan ‚Äî they don't like it when you callsomeone "macaca" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal eitherand are fans of "law and order." They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth but like good schools and a cleanenvironment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives balancedbudgets are the ultimate "good government" indicator for these voters.Clinton delivered on all of these issues keeping tax increases fairly small and balancing the budget for much of his term.In so doing ‚Äî and this is very important ‚Äî he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility economicgrowth moderate taxes and smart government. In other words he finally shed the "Carter" label for the Democrats. Thisin turn made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.George W. Bush's presidency in turn was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agendaa fiscal trainwreck two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later these suburban voters trended even moreheavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008 Democrats held most of the suburban districts around major metropolitan areas and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have puttogether a massive 2008 Presidential majority combining minorities liberals Jacksonians Catholics and suburbanites.The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left thestage but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obamareceived 53% of the vote instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among theremaining portions of his base. In other words while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's it was deeper. Faced withvanishing 401ks and home values and disgust with Bush's presidency suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals wereenthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first blackPresident.But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once and governing a coalition of suburbanitespoor blacks and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of theparty gone if that enthusiasm dissipates or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out thedoor the party isn't left with much.We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001 and look atthe counties that Mark Warner won.The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some it blended together rural Democrats in themining counties in the west of the state college voters around Charlottesville and black voters combined with rural whitesin the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalitionbut it worked.Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That areabecomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis Mondaleand Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved induring the 1920s.As I said this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other thanObama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that theJacksonian divorce may in fact be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state and seemed ‚Äî atleast on paper ‚Äî capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen obviously. Let's look at how Virginiachanged from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:The redder a county is the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved towardDemocrats.We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs ‚Äî but no better. Those pockets of white are the DCsuburbs in the northeast the Hampton Roads area in the southeast and Richmond just to the north and west of HamptonRoads. Its rural Virginia ‚Äî which is still about 1/3 of the electorate ‚Äî that made the difference between Bush's 54% in2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop theticket rural Virginia went solidly Republican.We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let'scompare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map we look at "relative movement." Becauseeverything in the state moved toward McDonnell a map just showing "movement" would be solid dark red and not ofmuch use. So instead if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell it is colored a shade of red if it movedless than 9 points toward McDonnell it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].We see the same result. Just since 2005 rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven'tmoved much at all relative to the rest of the state while the more heavily African American counties in the southernportion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). Thissuggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again because the movement here was sodramatic statewide we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at "relative" shifts.The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008 but that's because they were already giving Republicansaround 70% of the vote ‚Äî there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember "blue" in a relative map stillmeans slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come inthe DC exurbs in the 1-95 corridor and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.In other words the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able towin without them but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words two pieces of theClinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party there isvery very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy tomake an understatement hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault but the $787 billion stimulus the trilliondollar healthcare bill the automobile bailout and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decademake suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for atsome point ‚Äî probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt as they do most Presidents in their firstyear but they are becoming very very worried and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise toenact a net spending cut any more.Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate but when themood of the country is starting to swing against your party it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this outwhen he ran in a similar environment in 2005 and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the deathpenalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008 I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18points even holding everything else equal.The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats inthe House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia or came close to losing were suburban. The Philly suburbsvoted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote likeit did in 1984 but Chris Christie nearly carried it and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie ToddWhitman or Tom Kean he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. ConservativeRepublicans won elections in Westchester County New York and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on theoutskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figuresprominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executivethere with an obscure underfunded candidate. In other words in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seenhis attack ads on McDonell's thesis the Democrats still lost suburban voters.States with a Democratic base of liberals urbanites and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't movedmuch against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor andSenator in classic "Emerging Democratic Majority" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And ofcourse in Jacksonian states like Kentucky he's below 40%.This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy Republican missteps and a host of otherfactors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the pollsto enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting toshow its downside for downticket Democrats.The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart Democrats could findthemselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.Sean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.Page Printed from:http://www.realclearpolitics.comiarticles/2009111/13/can_the_clinton_coalition_survivethe_age_of_obama_99046.html at November 13 2009 - 08:19:49 AM CST",0

"The Palace of King of Ogoni Kingdom Ogoni Oil producing community Rivers State Nigeria. Dear Sir I am Princess IFEOMA  daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonime the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25 years old and studying Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late dictator General Sani Abacha my father suffered stroke and died in NOVEMBER27th LAST year. But before his death he called me and told me he has One Hundred and Five Million United States Dollars (USD105000000.00) cash in his possession specially deposited in a Bank . He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My moth! er did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my fatherÔøΩs properties companies e.t.c. we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally if he dies we cannnot get anything as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of ! God you will help us move this money out of the {BANK} to your country where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement and God will bless you as you help us. PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.

"Greetings to you. From Richard OheneBefore I introduce myself I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it with seriousness. This letter must come to you as a big surprise but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name is Richard Ohene the present branch Manager of a bank here in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I saidI have a transaction that will benefit both of us as your assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on so that was how I became the present Manager anddiscovered a fortune. As I resumed duty I discovered an account with total sum of $12500000 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my investigation I found out that this accountbelongs to one Late Mr. ANDREAS SCHRANNER a German great industrialist and a resident of Munich who unfortunately lost his life along with his entire famillies in the plane crash of CONCORDE AIRLINE[Flight AF4590 ] which crashed on 25TH JULY 2000. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation; <http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm>. The account is escrow call account a secret type of account in my bank and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a closemonitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Andreas Schranner meaning that no one is aware of the account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the nextof kin to the account with the correct information concerning the account which I shall give you.I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you. There is practically no risk involved the transaction will beexecuted under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.

"Dear Beloved in Christ Please bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it as I know we don't know each. It's my belief that I am doing the lord's bidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the courage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start I will need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and unbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life but I trust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in my heart. It is by the grace of God that I received Christ having known the truth; I had no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and glory upon my life. I am Mrs. Sandra White the wife of Mr. Robert White my husband was an expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently this money(with accrued interest) is still with the Bank and the management just wrote me as the next of Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has become DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the completion of the 4 years and if I as the beneficiary of the funds do not re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my condition(note that you need to activate this account) as I can not come over. Presently I'm in a hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I will die closer to nature and the lord) where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the World that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth here in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800000 USD. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this responsibility to any one of them any more. I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or you are not even a christian but today this moment as you read this open your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why would a total stranger like me be sending you this be telling you this and be offering this much. Beloved to be sincere with you I HAVE NO IDEA except that I know that the lord's way are not our ways. I have come to conclude that's it's divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by his breath he gave us life so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty of his plans his intentions his wish for the world then it will become very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you are chosen for this you other than someone else. It's all part of the big picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend forever............ Please I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who will use this money to fund churches orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I donÔøΩt have any child that will inherit this money and my husbandsÔøΩ relatives are not Christians and I donÔøΩt want my husbandsÔøΩ hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I donÔøΩt want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not communicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husbandsÔøΩ relatives around me always. I donÔøΩt want them to know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my husband's wealth and not my health. With God all things are possible. Your Sister in ChristMrs. Sandra White.",1
"HelloI am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As you read this don't feel sorry for me because it is the destiny of everyman to die someday. I am Jaron Abbas an Israeli by birth and a business merchant based in Scotland. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my trade. Though I am very well to do I was never open handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more to life than just prosperity.I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is imminent I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far I have been able to reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.The last of my belonging which no one knows of is the huge deposit of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe keeping company abroad which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.deJaron Abbas",1

"Dear By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc Lagos Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. Since the demise of this our customer Engineer Joseph Schultzman who was an oil merchant/contractor I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . By this doing what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address company or residential so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. Trusting to hear from you I remain Respectfully yours Mr. Idris Umar. NB:FOR SECURITY REASONS PLEASE REVERT BACK TO ME VIA THIS MY ALTERNATIVE MAILBOX:(idrisumar71@rediffmail.com) FIND MY CELL NUMBERS 234 80 33338093. ___________________________________________________GO.com Mail Get Your Free Private E-mail at http://mail.go.com",1
"OML SA  2nd Floor Building 3Grayston Drive Sandton JoburgSouth Africa.Dear I am Mr.Smith Anderso the Head of Audit Department African Developemnet Banksouth Africa And for reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on I obtained your address particulars from an Internet address listing. Please exercise some patience and read through my message. I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1999 a Crude Oil Contractor with the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation Engr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa  a national of kuwait made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months value $36MUSD (Thirty six million United States dollars only)in my branch. On maturity we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally his contract employers the Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform us that Engr. A Y Mustafa died on an automobile accident; that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the kuwait embassy were fruitless. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the Government of his country kuwait and was consequently driven into exile. My proposal therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to Mr. Mustafa nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin and therefore also by this means we transfer this money total $36MUSD abroad for us to share. No one will ever come forward to claim it now and according to South African lawafter 9 years the money will automatically revert to the Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner and certified dead and there is no valid claim. This indeed is the situation. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!. Once you indicate your interest I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 14 working days the money total $36MUSD will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Looking forward to your urgent reply. Reply to this email:smith_ad505@yahoo.com Yours trulyMr.Smith Anderso.",1

"Neera TandenMonday November 1 2010 11:35 PMHi HillaryI hope you are enjoying your travels. I'm trying to keep the Go Fight Win spirit but I must confessit's a bit hard.I promise I will do this rarely if at all in the future but I am once again sending my column. Thistime I am doing so because it references you and also because it created some buzz related to theprimaries.Looking forward to seeing you in December.NeeraPO!T1CSThe Female FactorJcw the Democrats can regain women 3 faith‚Äîand fightfor their interests.era 111"(leP1MORE FROM TH!S AUTHORNeera Tanden: How ¬∞barna Can Win the Battle Over the EconomyWhat Will It Tate For the Left to Rally Behind Obama Again?Tanden: Why Liberal Dissatisfaction With Obarna Is Way OverblownLast week as Democratic candidates across the country reached out to female voters in the final swingbefore Election Day. the White House released a report on howThe report highlights the Obama's administration's efforts and accomplishments on behalf of.‚Äòvomen's economic success‚Äîsmall business expansion that helps female business owners jobs tax creditsthat help women (and lnera) find jobs and laws to enforce equal pay for equal work‚Äû among otherinitiatives. Yet the report passed with little fanfare and even less media attention‚Äîlike so many otheraspects of the president's remarkably pro-woman policy agenda.It's almost tragic how this agenda has fallen under the radar during Obama's first two years in office. Wehear too often about abortion's controversial role in the year-long health care negotiations‚Äîbut notenough about other women-centered issues that after being promoted by activists for years have finallymade it into legislation. These go beyond the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The American Reinvestmentand Recovery Act dramatically expanded child care provisions and Head Start. The health cafe billcontained over $i billion to support nurses visiting new and expectant mothers at home a program thatwomen's groups and economists alike have championed as a smart investment. An even bigger victory isthe CLASS Act also part of the health care bill which provides a basic cash benefit to people (oftenwomen) who are taking care of the elderly at home.Yet I can probably count on my hand the number of people including women who actually know aboutthese new laws. Amid the din of bad news about the economy and misinformation about health carereform these policies don't stand a chance sadly of getting much media coverage. it doesn't help that theDemocrats haven't done enough to shine a public spotlight on them.But they could soon be lost in an even deeper abyss: The rampant individualism and free-marketfundamentalism support-ed by the Republican Party which seems on the 1.Drecipice of controlling -dieHouse and possibly the Senate could undo these initiatives entirely. What's more the new Republiicpmwave could mute the voice of women and their most important advocates on the national stage.The Ten Parties fueled by wealthy multimillionaires are running extreme candidates‚Äîincludingwomen like Sharron Angie and Christine O'Donnell‚Äîwho want to get rid of policies that help women themost. If the health care bill gets repealed for instance the new provisions for !ong-term care would go outthe window making decades worth of advocacy work moot.But the Tea Parties threaten women in other ways too. .ff the Republicans take back the _House theDemocratic Party will lose one of its most powerful women: Speaker Nanc‚Äû' Pelosi who currently has moreclout than any woman on the other side of the aisle Meanwhile Republicans like Sarah Palin and NikkiHaley will only gain political power‚Äîand with that .power attract more attention to their extreme views.If these Republicans become the nation's loudest voices of seemingly strong women that could portendfor a shift among younger women's allegiances toward the Republican Party and its platform.Already despite the stark realities about what Republicans will likely take away from women once. they arein power we are seeing rumbling of such a change: After forming the backbone of Democratic majoritiesfor years working-class women are wobbling in theii support the the Obama administration. According toa fron. last week while femaie college graduates savor Democratic overRepublican control (56 percent to 36 percent) women With only some college or a vocational educationare running almost even k A ‚Ä¢ 'Perhaps in their growing economic anxiety this group of women wafits to throw out incumbents theyperceive have not sufficiently focused on their economic progress. But of course if the media paid moreattention to Obama's pro-woman agenda‚Äîand both advocates and policymakers did more to broadcastit‚Äîthese key voters would know that the Democrats not Republicans are the politicians who have theirinterests in mind.Democrats can't let this continue‚Äîthey can't allow Republicans to brand themselves as the party of strongfemale leaders or allow women to gradually become a constituency of the right. That's why it's critical tohave standout women in the party. If Pelosi loses is there a powerful enough Democratic woman tocompete with these Republicans in the national spotlight? There's Hillary Clinton who as Secretary ofState has sent a powerful signal to the country and the world about the importance of female leadership inthe Obama administration But as a technically non-partisan international figure Hillary won't be able todo public battle with the rising rightPerhaps a Governor Sink‚Äîif she wins‚Äîin Florida could be among a new class of strong female Democrats.The ¬∞barna administration would also do well to elevate v./onien in the exe.cutive branch and turn publicattention to those who are already there.In addition to ‚Ä¢presenting women as the face of the patty Democrats must focus on issues like long-termcare child care and equal pay all of which could rise to the legislatle fore in the coming months.Republicans will likely directly attack or cut beck investments in these initiatives. When this happens theWhite House (and Democrats more broadly) would be wise to e.:;olain what ili niean for women if thesei ‚Ä¢nitiatives are gutted or lost‚Äîand to fight tooth and nail to make s-a‚Ä¢.e that doesn't happen.If it doesn't take these steps the Democratic Party could lose ts grasr on a cr3-ni‚Äòal. Pveii central 7-eit of itscoalition. And women in the long run would suffer under conservative laws that parrot family -values butdo nothing to value families.Neera Tanden is the chiTcoperatina office of Center for . ozriefn P‚Äîoc-ress SJ.e served in theObalRe. and C:-:;qton adininistrUHOTZS..‚ñ†1?;;RT :‚Ä¢IAR7.0 0;n:cr",0

A foreigner Late Engineer William Adams an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal Government of Nigeria until his death three years ago in a ghastly air crash banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC Lagos and had a closing balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman board of directors Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu that an arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLIAMABLE " and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition which will further enhance thecourse of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund USD$22.2M would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as thebeneficiary next of kin.

"Dear Sir/MadamThis letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu a merchant in Dubai in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital. Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you. If you can help respond back to me on my private email:razaq_samiu01@yahoo.es ",1

The ship isscheduled to arrive in Haiti later this week.Large amphibious ships like Iwo Jima resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter andlanding craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-reliefmissions on short notice.A crew of 1600 military and civilian medical engineering aviation logistical and other support personnel are embarkedaboard Iwo Jima including U.S. Navy engineers a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertisevolunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s) as well as medicaldental and engineering professionals from Europe North America and South America.Eight CH-46 Sea Knight medium-lift dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibiouslanding craft units (ICU's) are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies rangingfrom traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions.Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season theship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment ready to support U.S.disaster relief efforts when directed.Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix Haiti from July 24 through Aug. 3.

"Here is rasmussen statement at press conf today:On behalf of NATO I warmly welcome President Obama's announcement on the new US approach and commitment tothe mission in Afghanistan. President Obama's decision to substantially increase the numbers of US forces in the NATO-led operation is proof of his resolve; the overall approach he laid out is a broader political strategy for success. TheUnited States' contribution to the NATO-led mission has always been substantial; it is now even more important.But thisis not a US mission alone: America's Allies in NATO have shared the risks costs and burdens of this mission from thebeginning. As the US increases its commitment I am confident that the other Allies as well as our Partners in themission will also make a substantial increase in their contribution. Taken together the new force contributions fromacross the Alliance as well as the new approach agreed by all the ISAF countries will help create a new momentum inthe mission in 2010.",0
"MRS. MARIA SOCORROCREDIT ACCOUNTS OFFICERHEAD OFFICE EQUITABLE PCI BANK TWR.MKT AVENUE. COR.H.V DELA COSTA STRPHILIPPINES.Good DayLet me start by introducing myself I am MRS MARIA SOCORRO CREDIT ACCOUNTS OFFICER EQUITABLE PCI BANK. I am writing you this letter based on the latest development at my bank which I will like to bring to your personal edification. I am writing you this letter with so much joy and excitement even though my heart goes out to the very powerfuland distinguished gentleman who I was fortunate to have worked for and extremely privileged to have known for numerous years.I am a top official in charge of client accounts in EQUITABLE PCI BANK inside the Philippines.In 2001 my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the United States Of America and Was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament my client came to me with a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds ten million two hundred thousand dollars($10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection.Due to his untimely death in early 2002 the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it.

"PIR <preines(Wednesday March 17 2010 12:59 AMHuma AbedinSteinberg Project: First (Baby) Stephttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/when-a-schedule-is-more-than-a-schedule/37587/When A Schedule Is More Than A ScheduleBy Marc Am binderThe Atlantic.comMar 16 2010 9:45 PM ETClose observers of the State Department noticed something different this afternoon: on the daily schedule distributedby the department includes for the first time information on Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg's appointments.Until recently the daily release included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's schedule only. No longer."Steinberg will meet Wednesday with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean."The inclusion of Steinberg suggests that the department is aware that it needs to do a better job of integratingSteinberg's portfolio into its general communications strategy and show how the leadership of the department acts inconcert."Jim has always been an integral part of the Secretary's team but we haven't always shown how crucial he is to State'smission" said Philippe Reines Clinton's communications consiglieri. "This is a one simple way to fix that."The Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn't happy or that he's not seen as an integral part ofPresident Obama's foreign policy team or that his efforts aren't appreciated.Reines who rarely speaks on the record responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in thisway: "I'm not a shrink and I have to confess that we don't sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. Butwhat is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart dedicated and valued."Steinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration's team lead cybersecurityand China (he's been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran) but his work often goesunnoticed.On Friday he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren about thatcountry's actions during a visit by Vice President Biden.When President Obama selected Gen. Jim Jones as National Security Adviser he asked Clinton to make Steinberg herdeputy -- and she did. Since day one prognosticators have been predicting friction between Steinberg and Clintonalthough none has publicly surfaced.",0

" DEAR CEO/DIRECTORI know that this business proposal will come to you as a surprise since we donÔøΩt know each other before but that doesn't mean that you will not be of a great help to mebut first let me introduce myself I am MR. JOSEPH ZODWAZD the CHIEF AUDITOR OF AMALGAMATED BANKS OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA). There is an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again but all this came to light after an internal auditing that I conducted by going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out immediately it would be forfeited for no reason.The owner of this account is MR SMITH B. ANDREAS a foreigner and a miner at Kruger gold co a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involve! d is (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account was MR SMITH B. ANDREAS. We will sign an agreement but I assure you that it is real and a genuine business. Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone number and a fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement together so that we can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of our choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal sharing and other investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account and a foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. I have a correct information of this account which I will give to you later if you are able and willing to handle such an amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need a trustworthy person in this business because I donÔøΩt want to make a mistake I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreign reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business you will be given 30% of the total amount 60% will be for me and meanwhile 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply.If my proposal is acceptable to you and you are willing to help me please let me know so that you will enable me to transfer the fund without any further delay or If there is anything beyond your understanding your welcome to e-mail or fax me on the number written above because time is of essence.I will hang-on until I hear from you soon.Yours FaithfullyMR.

An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death of my husband my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the government and the press about my husband. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and all assests siezed. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control. The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all our accounts both local and international but my only hope now is the available US$100Million cash which I carefully packaged and deposited with a security finance company in Holland.My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the funds will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time when I will be free from my present predicament.Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial.

Bolkiah the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiahformer Finance Minister of Brunei the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the GulfIsland.I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family historywhich has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brotherthe sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.As you may know from the international media the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billiondollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office.However my father was kept under house arrest his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate.Furthermore during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives but before I could do that I was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail.Before my In-castration I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under special arrangement into the custody of different Private security and Trustee company s for safe keeping abroad.",1

"SWEETIE AMINAT USMANE.MAIL:ami44000@netzero.netTEL:234-8034540228Dear Sir/MadamI am LADY SWEETIE AMINA USMAN Bank Manager of ZenithInternational Bank of NigeriaAdeola Odeku BranchLagos . I have urgent and veryconfidential business proposition for you. On June 6 1999 an American Oil consultant/contractorwith the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. Barry Kelly made anumbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months valued atUS$35000000.00 (Thirty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Uponmaturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but gotno reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discoveredfrom his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporationthat Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On furtherinvestigation I found out that he died without making a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discoveredthat Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all hisofficial documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. Thissum of US$35000000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is beingrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at theexpiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of theNigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as aforiegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that thefruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of somecorrupt government officials.This is simple I will like you to provide immediatelyyour full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare thenecessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the nextof kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney fordrafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents andletter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.We would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next ofkin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Barry Kelly to travel andclaim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe or sub-regionalAfrican country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing houseto the bank.The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratioof 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for thistransaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the BranchManager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.If you are interested please reply immediately viathe private email address below. Upon your responseI shall then provideyou with more details and relevant documents that will help youunderstand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality and restassured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because Ishall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Pleasefurnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and fastercommunication.

"Hello my beloved kind hearted THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION! I simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to =contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help =as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial =entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against =Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down. It might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of =Public Works here in Pretoria South Africa it is my responsibility to handle =some very intrinsic matters for on behalf or with the Minister. By my =duties it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the =Minister for approval without it passing through my scrutiny. By my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public =Works I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly =American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the =government of South Africa. I did this principally as a help to the =concerned companies but in appreciation of my efforts most of them =committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. =However because of my position as a political appointee it is impossible =for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence I need you =to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further =directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort =will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this =regards. All the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to =Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855000) =only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn't collect this money =directly from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family =members because government will investigate "why?" and "what for? Therefore =to forestall any such problems I decided to contact you through this secured =and private medium to solicit your assistance in this regard. You will receive this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further =directed. That way there will be no link between the companies and me. I =will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on =installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more =than $75000 as the case may be. >From the money you receive on my behalf you would be entitled to retaining =10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its =purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example if you =receive $75000 you would be required to retain 10% ($7500) while you wire =the balance $67500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a =simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds =would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to =actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it's simple and =risk free. You receive the money on my behalf take away your 10% and =redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if =you keep to our agreement this will be the beginning of a mutually =beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward there are a lot of =other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune. If you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against =Cholera and HIV/AIDS I would need you to provide me with the following: (1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:Provide me with:a). Name of your bank.b) Address of your bank.c) Bank Telephone and Fax.d) Account Number.e) Swift Code/Routing Number.d)Account Names. (2).OTHERWISE IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK: Then you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me =with:a) Your full names (As would be on the check).b) Contact/Mailing addressc) Your Telephone and Fax Number. Furthermore as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf =I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License =for record purpose. When I receive all the aforementioned I will then send a working AGREEMENT =between you and I to guide and guard this relationship. Once all these are sorted out I will notify the first company of my desire =to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly. In conclusion: I wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill who =wrote: "To exist is to changeTo change is to matureTo mature is to go on creating one's self endlessly" As we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation let us =continue to dream that one-day very soon Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no =longer devastate our nation that all of our young people will resort to =responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once =more dominate our society. LET US DARE TO DREAM. For it is not an impossible dream. This is simply from my heart to you. I wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting =business relationship with you.

"Dear Beloved Friend I am Mrs. Susan John from London ; I am married to Mr. John Mike who worked with London embassy for Ten years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $9.8Million (NINE Million Eight hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with one Bank in London Presently this money is still with the Bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in the Bank I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages widows propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that grivet. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband&#8217;s efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the Bank in London that you are the beneficiary of the said fund in London . I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply and Remain blessed in the Lord. Yours in ChristMrs. Susan JohnGREETINGS FROM MRS SUSAN JOHN",1

"'Inept' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun May 16 2010RIYADH (AFP)‚Äî An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on "chasing theterrorists" there former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle Eastpeace talks and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.AFP ‚Äî Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people andhad no hope of rebuilding the country."What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists" Turki told the ArabNews conference.US President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by militarymeans.""Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border arrest them or kill them and get out and let theAfghan people deal with their problems."As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideologicalmercenaries."Turki who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations scolded Washington's handling of relations withKabul."The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement."Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths" he said. "How can they both get out of thatsituation? I don't know."The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies Turki has no official position but is believed tooften reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and analysts speculate he could become foreign ministerwhen Saud retires.Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks."The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done" said Turki."It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk."If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise thePalestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist."He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with theIsraelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions please."Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon."The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does notwork" he said.For one he said the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand and other nuclearcountries on the other."You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel India Pakistan and North Korea to play on other levels."Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for thecountries in the area and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone after the UN Security Council's fivepermanent members recently expressed support for the idea."Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone"he said."Why then did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"Turki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free ofweapons of mass destruction."Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year warning both internal and externalgroups seek to carve up the country."Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout he said.Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders the consequence could be "regional conflict on ascale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries" he warned.",0

"Greetings from Dubai This letter must come to you as a big surprise but I believe it is only a =day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am =Mr. Ali Raza Khan currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank =here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith believing that I =can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =November 6 2000 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the =CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION MR. jack farrer powell made a (Fixed deposit) =for 36 calendar months valued at US$17500000.00 (Seventeen Million Five =hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present =position recently. Upon maturity in 2003as his account officer and as well =the bank manger it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a =routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned =undelivered. After sometime I tried sending back the letterbut it was again returned and =finally I discovered from his contract employers Chevron Petroleum =Corporation that Mr.jack farrer powell died as a result of torture in the =hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to =his country Iraq as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =On further investigation I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell family =wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he =did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did =not leave any WILL.This sum of US$17500000.00 have been floating and placed =under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have =heard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the =investigation I have made so far my bank management is not aware of it I am the only one that have the information. With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By =end of this year the government will pass a new financial control law which =will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =$5000000.00 to explain the source of the funds making sure it is not for =terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country =immediately by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to =late jack farrer powell  coupled with my present position and status in the =bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug  I have the power to influence the =release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the =account with the correct information concerning the account which I shall =give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully =worked out and there is practically no risk involved the transaction will be =executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law beside U. A. E is porous and =anything goes. If you accept to work with me I want you to state how you wish us to share =the funds in percentage so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are =interested contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please treat with utmost =confidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account =issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your =urgent response soon.

"Hello Friend.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Dasuki Al-Mehmood a merchant in Dubai U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business.Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $6M. (Six Million United States Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10 % for you and God be with you. Please All correspondence should be directed to Dasuk-al-mehmo@excite.comRegardsDasuki Al-mehmoodDasuk-al-mehmo@excite.com",1

"Setup for foreign policy TV debate on Thursday. Obviously this is a popular position. Clegg is now at the height of hispopularity and playing to public opinion. Clegg is pushing off both Brown (still suffering from Obama's dismissive slightsunpopularity of Afghanistan and deepest factor Bush poisoning of the well) and Cameron (making him an oldThatcherite pro-US anti-EU). Clegg is an ardent Europeanist not so much Americanist.http://itn.co.uk/b0929495306b2635ca77854b1db33626.htmlClegg: special relationship with US is overTue Apr 20 2010 20:38:43ctThe "special relationship" between Britain and the United States is over Nick Clegg has said.The Liberal Democrat leader said Barack Obama's administration "understood the world had changed" and the UK'sleaders needed to end their "slavish" devotion to Washington.Mr Clegg also warned against "sabre-rattling" over Iran's nuclear ambitions and repeated his pledge to offer a referendumon the UK's continued membership of the European Union when the issue next arose.The Lib Dems have ruled out replacing Trident with a like-for-like system and Mr Clegg said the UK should consider "nothaving a continuous at sea deterrent".In a speech to the Foreign Press Association in London Mr Clegg said it was time to challenge the "conventional wisdom"that had lasted since the Suez crisis about the UK's relationship with the US.He said: "I think it's sometimes rather embarrassing the way Conservative and Labour politicians talk in this kind of slavishway about the special relationship. If you speak to hard-nosed folk in Washington they think 'it's a good relationship but it'snot the special relationship'."",0

My intention of contacting you is to =solicit your assistance for a project which will be mutually beneficial. =Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional =the prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema Hamza =from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was =an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the =year 2000. We were married for twelve years without a child. He died after a =brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer =and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he made a huge deposit in =millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you =the amount as we proceed).Recently my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer =problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my =condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or =devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to =instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the =orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim =organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund =mosques orphanages widows and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to =ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has =encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't =have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into =some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will =be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this bold decision I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most =beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in =this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's =relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. =With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on =Email:hhamza@cooltoad.com I shall give you the contact information of the =Deposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will also issue a =letter of authority to the Deposit Company authorizing them that the said =fund have being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be =forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to =always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims =worthy of emulation Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in =truth and in fairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you =as it will have to be on pre-negotiated terms based on your level of =involvement. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply =will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for =this same purpose. Until I hear from you by email my dreams will rest =squarely on your Shoulders. May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and =protect you. Allah Hafiz.

It has ever been my husband dream toinvest in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabic as a true Muslim soI will want us to keep his dream alive.I have prayed and Allah has directed me to you I Hope toreceive your positive response on how to move thisinvestment forward. On your reply you should let me knowwhat plans you have for my investment capital currently ina safe deposit Vault in cash. I will arrange for a businessmeeting with you to finalize the areas of your investmentand financial disbursement. This fund was diverted from the Chechen treasury anddeposited in the Vault in cash on my name because my latehusband would not want anybody to know that he isassociated with the fund. My primary objective is to movethis fund out of Europe as quickly as possible. Allarrangement in this regard has been concluded and as soonas you give your consent to take custody of this fund themovement can be effected.You should also let me have some details about yourself andyour business. I will also be able to give you furtherdetails on my personal profile including contact details.I am aware that in order to undertake this responsibilityyou should logically be entitled to some personal gratuitywhich will be a percentage of the fund in question.

"E-Mail Address hellenshakashaka@netscape.netDear FriendYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me =personally. I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in =Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. =Before the death of my father he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum =of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars) in one of the =security company as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money =was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the =Security Company.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the =Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came =when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act =Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers =and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans =and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because =of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is =against this background that I and my family fledZimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.After which I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the =Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to =transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law =of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to =be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of =European Union. As the eldest child of my father I am saddled with the =responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be =transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking =everything we have got.The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced =with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for =fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar =political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future =and that of my family in his hands I must let you know that this transaction =is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do =for me is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the =Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i =have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the =Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of =ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can =choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account =for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper =profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you =want feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all =kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money =while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of =your choice. while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required =in this transaction.I await your immediate reply and God bless.Best regardsHellen Shaka ZumaNOTE:ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I =CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.--03b0053a-328c-4d8d-8e87-d41a0d293fec--",1

LOME-TOGOI AM THE MANAGER BILL AND EXCHANGE OF THE FOREIGNREMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF BANQUE TOGOLAISE DEDEVELOPPEMENT.I am writing you following the impressive informationabout your profile through the website. Therefore Ibelieved that you shall posess the capability andreliability to champion this opportunity with me.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 14million US dollars (Fourteen million US dollars) inan account that belongs to one of our foreigncustomers who died along with his entire family inDecember2002 in a plane crash. Since we got the urglyinformation about his death we have been expectinghis next of Kin to come over and claim his moneybecause we can not release it unless somebody appliesfor it as next of Kin or relation to the deceased asindicated in our banking and financial policies butunfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kinor relation died along side with him in the accidentleaving no body behind to claim the money.It istherefore upon this discovery that I and otherofficials in my department now decided to makethis business proposal to you and release the money toyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased forsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody iscoming for it and we dont want this money to go intothe Bank treasury as unclaimed bills. The Banking lawand guideline here stipulates that if such moneyremained unclaimed after five years the money will betransferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in thisbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customerwas a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as nextof kin to the deceased family.We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you asforeign partner in respect to the provision of aforeign account 5% will be set aside for expensesincurred during this transaction and 75 % would be forme and my colleagues. Thereafter I and my colleagueswill visit your country for disbursement according tothe percentages indicated.To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to youas arranged above you must apply first to the Bank asthe relation or next of kin to the deceased indicatingyour private telephone and fax numbers for easy andeffective communication and location wherethe money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by faxor e-mail the text of the application. I will not failto bring to your notice that this transaction is hitchfree and that you should not entertain any atom offear as all required arrangements have been made forthe transfer.You should contact me on my E-MAIL as soon as youreceive this letter. I decided to contact you as wehave products of interest in your part of the worldwhere we can invest our own percentage to avoidpeoples awareness as we are civil servants. With youracceptance and cooperation we can conclude thisoperation within ten working days. Please keep thisvery confidential.May God be with you.Yours faithfullyWilliam Drallo.	__________________________________Do you Yahoo!?SBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.http://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/"",1

""Demak Laut street93050 KuchingSarawakMalaysia. Dear Friend I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Sheik Sharif Ahmed who worked with South Africa Embassy in Malaysia for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both are Muslims. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which my prinsple is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.3Million (Five Million three hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with one Security Finance Company in Europe. Presently this money is still with the Security Finance Company . Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to any Islamic or better still an muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the DubaiAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the one that is with the Security Finance Company.I want a muslam or individual that will use this to fund Islamic orphanages and widows propagating the word of Allah and to ensure that the house of Allah is maintained. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money USD$5.3M and my husband relatives are not Muslam. and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where these money USD$5.3M will be used in an ungodly manner hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Allah the almight. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my healthand because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always who are not muslam. I don't want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security Finance Company abroad. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Islamic to always pray for me because the Allah is my shephard. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a muslam or Islamic individual for this same purpose. l will require your Personal Phone number and if possible your Residential address to include in the Power of Attorney that my lawyer will prepare in your name as the Beneficiary that will empower you to act on my behalf when you contact the Security Finance Company to receive the money USD$5.3M on my behalf. The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on Allah's benevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold step.I took this decision because of my faith as a Muslim and with Allah every things are possible. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you. Allah be with youMrs. Zainab Sharif Ahmed "",1

I am making this contact to you in respect of US 28000000.00 (Twenty eight million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late father. This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary status. The lodgment Security Code Number was also revealed to me he then advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad who will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary so that the funds can be moved in your name and particulars to any country of your choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches I will then come over to meet you in person so that we can discuss physically on Investment entials.Based on this instance I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter the term shall be varied. 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses which may arise during the transaction fax and phone bills inclusive. The balance of 70% you will invest and manage for my family. I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money it is not drug money and it is not money from arms deal.Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this matter. I will give you all proof of deposit and existence of money once urged and fully satisfied with you capability and honesty. I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Sid2010: global cracks human prospects (part II)No‚Ä¢a‚ñ†iid Hayes 2 January 2010Subjects:‚Ä¢ Democracy and government‚Ä¢ International politicsMore openDemocracy authors reflect on a volcanic decade in global politics - continued from part IopenDemocracy deputy editor David Hayes asked openDemocracy writers to reflect on the decade that has passed andthe one that lies ahead by considering three questions:1)What was the most significant trend in the century's first decade?2) What do you most hope for and most fear about the decade to come?3) What idea do you see fading and/or emerging in 2010 and beyond?‚Ä¢ Sidney BlumenthalThe greatest challenge for the early 21st century is that China's leadership has contempt for much of the internationalorder and many of the international organisations developed since the second world war. In pursuit of its narrow and evencrude understanding of its interest China will constantly abuse and break international rules protocols and bodies. Itswillful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in abeggar-thy-neighbour approach environmental degradation and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generallyare the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism in Africa especially but alsoelsewhere China is able to gain help partly through economic intimidation in its international forays to repel or strikedown the responsibilities of internationalism.Internally China is a prison of nations an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union and may also be themost unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing but the authoritarian regime ishardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers orex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear ofoperating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with realchoice and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes ofentrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is accompanied by expandingarrogance demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.China's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity itself based incoherently on recklesseconomic development for example in the areas of currency environment and labour; it has no "soft power" not justbecause of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forcesits way through coercion of one sort or another.The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at arhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase "strategic reassurance" was risibleand did not last. For now the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vaticanto the Taliban - arrayed against modernity the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States mayeven have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutionalamendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the firstfemale one will not be so great.Sidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton and an Oscar and Emmy award-winning documentaryproducer.

"Hello. My Name is John Koenig A native of Britain I have been diagnosed with Oesophageal cancer. It has defied all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million three hundred thousand dollars ($18 300 000 00) that I have with a finance House abroad. I will want you to help the world collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.",1

Also it makes the US seemsutterly reasonable for the Israelis have already agreed to the core of these positions and arguments cannot be made thatthey would undermine security etc. Furthermore three-quarters at least of US Jews supported the Camp David peaceeffort.

"Welcome back to an unbelievable snowy mess in DC!I wanted to tell you that I met with the Lithuanian official who is heading up the Community of Democracies. Lithuaniahas the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. Itwas not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name ‚Äî among otherreasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specificpractical goals and tangible results ‚Äî among them one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you knowthey have a female president the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voiceswhen you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. Wetalked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflictresolution (1325) helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses wherethings appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna).I agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania.The Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation foughtfor (they remember being a "Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was littlelikelihood at the time that they'd ever become a democracy) and that today democracies are struggling in too manyplaces. It's as though we have to take back democracy's good name and focus it as a universal value to address thecritical challenges.Mike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group assomething tangible. He is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly. Since this was acreation of the Clinton Administration and since democracy is under siege in so many places I hope we will find a way towork with the Lithuanians and others who still want to see it make a difference. In some ways it may be more relevanttoday.

"Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his nextof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unlesssome body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arrangedyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application that i will send to youso i will like you to send to me your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

April 12011 11:53 AMRE: gorgeous pie on the front page of the NWT!Bic sending more arms into a society generally ‚Äî particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are‚Äî will result in more violence ‚Äî against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am allfor saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi but in a tribal society where conflictshave been repressed for so long adding even more weapons does not make sense.

"Dear I am writing to solicit your cooperation in executing a very profitable and risk free transaction. I have confidence that you have the ability to execute this business to our benefit and believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence I am willing to repose in you. I attended a Business seminar here in CÔøΩte d'Ivoire While in this seminar I was lucky to meet Alhaji Fofanah the owner of one of the largest Agricultural Firm dealing on Life stock ets. Alhaji Fofanah is an accomplished agriculturist who specialise in cattle farms and various other agricultural product for export. He has farm in different countries of West Africa. But above all he is one of the greatest suppliers of cattle beef and other dairy products in this part of the world. Due to my relationship with Alhaji Fofanah and on getting to know my profession Alhaji Fofanah took me into confidence by informing me about huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular and very important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that he buys this product at the rate of $5000.00USD per carton and that he mostly buys to the excess of 300 cartons. He informed me that he was only asking me to find out if I can also source for him a cheaper supplier considering the recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market which is affecting his business. I discussed this business with someone here and he decided to handle the supply by himself. We carried out a market research and discovered that we could purchase this cattle medicine somewhere cheaper in Europe for $ 3000.00 USD per carton. We moved to Alhaji Fofanah to make a supply to him at $ 4800.00 USD per Carton of which he accepted. Owing to my role in the Whole arrangement I had an agreement with the man to be receiving 18% of whatever gain is made on each Supply since he is to finance the transaction of which he agreed. But on the 20th August 2005 when the first supply of 120 cartons were made to the Alhaji Fofanah The man decided to renegade on our agreement. He refused to give me anything near the agreement we arrived at but gave me only what he termed an offer of appreciation. I decided to overlook this betrayal but since then our relationship has seized to be cordial. He never said anything to me again about Alhaji Fofanah. But recently I visited Alhaji Fofanah he is requesting for supplies of 250 cartons of these substances following a suspected out break of disease among his cattle in Mali and Guinea. He has requested that these supplies be made before the mid August 2006. I convinced him that I can arrange for an international supplier who can supply him at the price of $ 4600.00 USD per Carton. But that he Alhaji Fofanah or his representative will have to go to Europe and inspect it before lifting the goods. At the moment Alhaji Fofanah is waiting for me or my foreign contact. If you can handle this project please contact me immediately for details on how to go about it and the negotiation on what is to be my commission. I am ready to give you Alhaji's contact for your direct conversation with him on the mode of payment method.",1

"Dear FriendGood day. I decided to contact you after I went through my fatherÔøΩs file. Hence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.My name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds a wealthy farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my country Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert mugabe murdered my father before I ran way from my country because I have become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in The MDC a party wanting to end the several years of brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father he deposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars (US$10000000.00) with a security companyThe money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security company organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.The government seized my fatherÔøΩs farms and bank account before his Murder. He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment of the fund I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge sum of money. In view of this The monetary policy/law does not allow such investment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please let me know if you can assist me so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.As I wait for your urgent Response please treat thisinformation as top secret. Then u can also contact me through this alternative mail (mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au)Yours SincerelyMr.Desmond Martin._________________________________________________________________Testez Windows Llive Mail Beta ! http://www.msn.frewhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f",1
"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCHCENTRAL HONG KONGHONG KONG.Dear Sir Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3years and 10months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind RegardsMr. Wang Qin___________________________________________________________________________http://snura.net",1

"Dear Friend.As you read this I don't want you to feel sorry forme because I believe everyone will die someday.My name is MR.HARRY HAKEEM a merchant in Dubai in theU.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a fewmonths to live according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well as Inever really cared for anyone(not even myself)but mybusiness. Though I am very rich I was nevergenerous I was always hostile to people and onlyfocused on my business as that was the only thing Icared for. But now I regret all this as I now knowthat there is more to life than just wanting to haveor make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to cometo this world I would live my life a different wayfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has calledme I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended familymembers as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soulso I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in the U.A.EAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health hasdeteriorated so badly I cannot do this myselfanymore. I once asked members of my family to close oneof my accounts and distribute the money which I havethere to charity organization in Bulgaria andPakistan they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is thehuge cash deposit of TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS$12000000that I have with a finance/Security Companyabroad. I will want you to help me collect this depositand dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 25% for you and for your time if you want to help me to collect this Funds and also invest this money.N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THELAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY HEDOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERYUNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOURSUCCESS IN JESUS NAME.",1

"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTIONAFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASOWEST AFRICA.Attention PleaseI am Musa Garuba the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million eighty five thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker)we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please you have been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communicationYours faithfullyMusa Garuba._________________________________________________________________Don't just search.

""Khan Anwaar Fharaad 5ÔøΩme Av. X Bd TÔøΩli Diallo Quartier Sandervallia Commune de Kaloum BP 5331 Conakry Guinea. Your attention please: I am Barrister Khan Anwaar Faraad a Guinean Solicitor & Financial Attorney. I was the personal attorney to a client who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Guinean Petroleum Corporation in Conakry  Guinea . The contractor here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant. He made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit of Twenty five million United States of America Dollars in one of the prime banks here in the state capital of with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity the routine notification was forwarded to me that I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without a reply. After a month I sent a reminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. Finally I discovered from my Client's contract employers- Guinean Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in an auto crash along LabÔøΩ express road. On further investigations I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Conakry Guinea . First I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Guinean law states that at the expiration of 5(five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Guinean Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund. Secondly as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to him so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal. I wish to point out that after the claims I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. If you are interested please contact me immediately. Upon your response I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us. I strongly believe every information is given for you to access my status before any further interactions. I go on anticipating your urgent co-operation. Thanks & Regards Barr. Khan A.

"Here is the latest draft which incorporates your changes and suggestions and has been through each of us (me Jakeand AMS) at least once. There may still be a few facts to be tweaked and we are looking for one more example fromWHA for the Mexico paragraph. I will also re-read it carefully later tonight and tomorrow morning to catch any typosweird grammar or things that don't flow. I'm too close to it now and want to read it again when I'm fresh.

"Dear friendAs you read this I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I Believe Everyone will die someday. My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and Right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich I was never generous I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give alms to charity organizations as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18000000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.mr. JAIN HAGISI will not want you to send me an email on this box. I will want you to send me an email on this box {jahagis3@myway.com}. This is because my brother saw me when I was sending this email to you and I will not want them to know that I am in contact with you. __________________________________________________________________________________MailMN-Mongol Tumnii Email.

"Dear Secretary ClintonI hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in theregion from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report but themain takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technicalanalysis of China's capabilities would suggest and for a range of reasons technical and political prospects for regionalcooperation are limited but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.All best JackieKey findings from the workshop include:‚Ä¢ Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher thanforecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1000kilometers of the Chinese coastline.‚Ä¢ The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area ofSSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols including India China and possibly Pakistan.‚Ä¢ Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral areahave continued to develop with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka to complement the existingrelations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of "blue-brown water" naval operations in whichChinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases but close to the coasts of client states.The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperationeasy. These trendsinclude:Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1000miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.‚Ä¢ Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan IslandChinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missilesubmarines operating close to India.‚Ä¢ Indian interest in SSBNs plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan andeven possibly Pakistani SSBNs all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean alongwith the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.‚Ä¢ Asymmetries in levels of operational competence and technology insubmarines and maritime aviation which for example make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder forstates that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.‚Ä¢ The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes inthis region which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets inhomeland areas.The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.The first scenario which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both compels us to consider:‚Ä¢ The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstratethat their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected and‚Ä¢ What the United States would lose if it did not support theJapanese and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed statecapable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon potentiallygiving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close toterritory of a client of China a "blue-brown water" clash. In this scenario China is using its navy to show presence andto force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less thanblack and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstancesunderscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of theirmilitary capabilities would suggest.On Fri May 22 2009 at 7:45 AM <newmyer wrote:> Secretary Clinton The Australian is the newspaper in which I read> your remarks on Asia-Pacific.

"I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha from Kuwait. I am married to Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million five hundred dollars) which he inherited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently this money is still with finance and security firm. Recently my doctor told me that I had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next four months. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches orphanages widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of alms charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with God the highest and the most merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of my lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this letter and accept to assist me to conclude this transaction if you want to speak with me he will arrange for that because my doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly I can't discuss in the presence ofmy husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the hospital my lawyer is the only person that knows the decision that I am taking.With God I know that all things are possible and as soon as I receive your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact of thefinance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though married to a Muslim whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in spirit please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in souring for another Christianorganization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders may the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

"Dear Sir I am Mr. Philip jones an official with one of the APEX banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$28500000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28500000.00 is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now no one will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. Consequently my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested please reply immediately via email. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help otherwise we'll take our share . Awaiting your urgent reply Mr.Philip Jones. ",1

Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father he took me toSouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying inSouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover the South African monetarypolicy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter.

SidNew blow for Conservative alliance with UUPas assembly member quits partyAlan McFarland follows MP Lady Hermon in resigning from Ulster Unionists to sit as independent‚Ä¢ Henry McDonaid Ireland correspondent‚Ä¢ gi;ardian.co.uk Wednesday 31 March 2010 09.48 BSTThe ConseNatives' alliance with the Ulster Unionists has sustained a second blow in North Down after last week'sresignation of the sitting MP Lady Hermon.Assembly member and former army major Alan McFarland announced today that he was leaving the UUP in protest at itspact with the Tories.It is expected McFarland will now work for Herman's re-election as an independent against the official UUP-Torycandidate.A UUP statement said the timing of McFarland's announcement was "disappointing". He has been a UUP member of theStormont assembly for 12 years and was once a loyal ally of Lord Trimble Nprthem Irelard's former first minister.Trimble has been one of the driving forces behind the UUP-Conservative alliance.Last night McFarland resigned his membership of the party and said he would now sit as an independent member of theassembly."With the recent confirmation of candidates including the imposition of a Conservative candidate in my own North Downconstituency‚Ä¢it is clear that the party is determined to continue down the Conservative road" he said in a statement."I do not wish to join them. I am sorry to leave a party that contains many good friends and greatly regret that events havedeveloped in the way they have."Last week Hermon the MP for North Down said she would run in the general election as an independent unionist.In a statement the Ulster Unionist party thanked McFarland for his service but said the "electoral pact has the potential totransform politics in Northern Ireland in a manner not previously witnessed" in Ulster.",0

"engage in business discussions with our Private Banking ServicesDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37million United States Dollars which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I madenumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chiefoperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department especiallygiven the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met onnumerous occasions prior to any investments being placed and however Iencouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. Thefavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternativeinvestments. Based on my advice we spun the money around variousopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months ofoperation the accrued profit with interest included stood at this pointat over 13.2 million United States Dollars this margin was not the fullpotential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns oninvestments. In mid 2001 he asked that the money be liquidated because heneeded to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. Hedirected that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm inEurope.I informed him that our bank would have to make specialarrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due processthe bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater forbanking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but latercame around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he wasasking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strictsince the incidents of 9/11.I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainlandEurope I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his preciseinstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a securityconsultancy firm the firm is a specialist private firm that acceptsdeposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations thathandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediateaccess to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiarespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In linewith instructions the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the moneythere in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This wasthe last communication we had this transpired around February 25th 2002.In June last year we got a call from the security firm informing us ofthe inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astoundingposition as far as I was concerned given the fact that I managed theprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit andI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.Imade futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task oflocating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Fourdays later information started to trickle in that he was apparentlydead a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heartattack in Cannes South of France; we were soon enough able to gather moreinformation and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediatelylaunched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alertabout the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If youare familiar with private banking affairs those who patronize ourservices usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment fromconventional processes. In his bio-data form he listed no next of kin. Inthe field of private banking opening an account with us means no one willknow of its existence accounts are rarely held under a name; depositorsuse numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also givesthe choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at thebank itself ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as Isaid rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apartfrom not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills inour care in this case; he died in testate.In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passedaway we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine whoshould have right to claim the estate this investigation for severalmonths were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our privateinvestigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It isthis investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contactdetails and contact you being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian as apotential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliatedwith this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that Iam the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party toreceive the results of the investigation. What this means with you beinga foreigner I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow diedwith no known or identifiable family member.This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what theprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the latebeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice the firm will by theend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim toour bank failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revertthe deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering ourbank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and outof the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I havemy way.What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but Iwant you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the bankingworld who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards forthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; youshould have begun by now to put together the general direction of what Ipropose. There is USD$ 11991674 deposited I alone have the depositdetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct themto do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as thefinance firm is concerned the transaction with our deceased customerconcluded when I sent the funds to the firm all outstanding interactionsin relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Thefinance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of thedeposit they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit toany party that comes forward and this is the situation.This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family ofthe deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no familybut however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I amprepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm torelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt",1

"sbwhoeopThursday October 22 2009 12:02 AMHfyi: Hague report and DeMint... SidH: Here's the Guardian account of Hague's post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. SWilliam Hague addresses US fears over Tories'EU allies‚Ä¢Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear'‚Ä¢Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader‚Ä¢ Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt‚Ä¢ quardian.co.uk Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BSTWilliam Hague the shadow foreign secretary yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties inEurope during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton.Hague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners some of whose members have taken part incommemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom inPoland.The shadow foreign secretary who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton told her the accusations were part of asmear campaign by the Guardian and others.The row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for takingpower.Speaking to the media afterwards Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski of Poland's Law and Justice party wasnot consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance Haguesaid: "This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous."Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics orissues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: "I can say that the two had a good wide-rangingdiscussion on a broad range of issues but can't get into details or substance of that discussion."Hague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play alesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.Hague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran theBalkans the Middle East Northern Ireland Afghanistan and climate change."No one has raised with me all day the other issue of the parties in our grouping but I raised that with secretary of stateClinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those" Hague said."I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as asmear campaign against some of its members."He noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism inEurope and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. "These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic"Hague said.As for the Latvians of the six governing parties "five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration thathave been criticised." Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance the European People's party.On Conservative Euroscepticism Hague said: "I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important todistinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be finda Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. "Later he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blairwould be appointed "over my dead body".http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequelIran-Contra's Scary Sequelby Art LevineThe Daily BeastOctober 10 2009 I 6:55pmRepublicans have opened a new front against Obama a southern front south of the border‚ÄîLatin America.The clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in theGeorge W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of SouthCarolina.A freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America DeMintis best known for boasting that health care would be the "Waterloo" that will "break" Obama. He recentlyprovoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to "assess" the crisis.The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya a leftist whowas expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his "intransigence"in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America and initially deniedmoney for DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through theDefense Department."DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order todefend a coup" says Adam Isacson a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for InternationalPolicy."Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet and paralyzed policy byprovoking the [DeMint] holds" Julia Sweig the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on ForeignRelations told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: "These losers from the Bush administration who droveLatin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy" one aide told The Daily Beast.A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin Americanpolicy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stanceagainst the president installed by the Honduran military Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire toappease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration "slow-walked" itsresponse to the coup this summer Sweig says.More recently though the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least$35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter intoserious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washingtonand helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelayalegal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich a Cuban-American who headed theState Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal and wassubsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel‚Äîand the U.S. Comptroller General whichfound he engaged in "prohibited covert activities" by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich whowas later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs andis now a private consultant launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption."Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelayacoup" he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as "crap"asserting they were only based on a fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin a LatinAmerican history professor at NYU has a darker view of Reich's role: "It's kind of the origins of SwiftBoating" he says. "It's all related to what he's doing now."Conservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against theworldwide condemnation of the coup. "It's not the first time all the countries in the world have been wrong"Reich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies takingThe New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby onbehalf of the Micheletti regime. "I guess my facts interfered with [the] story" he says. "Can you believe someof my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?" ADeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with Reich to talk about Honduras although a Reich aidesays they've spoken to DeMint's staff.Adding to the mystery of the coup left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservativessay are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. Hehas firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: "I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy chargesagainst me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya." But the rumors may add to his auraof power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations bypenning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined "I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras."Perhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyerMiguel Estrada whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by theSenate. In addition to Reich other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles ininfluencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega a former aideto the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as anassistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2 Noriega appeared on TheNewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a formerambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute‚Äînot as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.Noriega officially registered his firm Visions America as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-July. Yet the Times reported he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetingsbetween supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators‚Äîincluding DeMint‚Äîin early July. That visit toWashington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10 Foreign Policy reportedoccurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich‚Äîalong with a former Honduransupreme court justice and Lanny Davis a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist‚Äîtestifiedin favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama'spicks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon current assistant secretary for Western HemisphereAffairs has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela director of GeorgetownUniversity's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the NationalSecurity Council during President Clinton's second term has been tapped to be assistant secretary for WesternHemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committeein late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes "They're not polarizing figures."But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings Valenzuela angered DeMintby defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: "In my studies of militarycoups in Latin America this was a classic military coup" Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he hascontinually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holdsincluding the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.DeMint's spokesperson Wesley Denton says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about animportant crisis. "If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats then why hasn't Senator Reid broughtthem to the floor?" he asks. "There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote onthem." Technically that's true but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has takenup the issue of Honduras Denton claims because "the State Department's actions were directly relevant to twonominees seeking the committee's approval."Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras‚Äîin what critics say is yet another vehicle to "break"Obama‚Äîone congressional observer jokes "He couldn't find Honduras on a map."Art Levine a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly has written for Mother Jones The AmericanProspect The New Republic The Atlantic Slate.com Salon. corn and numerous other publications.

"Fehmi Mehmet110 Half Edge LaneEllesmere ParkEccles Greater ManchesterUnited KingdomMy Name is Fehmi Mehmi and I am a staff of Natwest Bank London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of ÔøΩ26.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty-Six Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000 including his wife and only daughter. Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into bankingtreasury as unclaimed funds.We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction.Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.Do call me and lets discuss more on this.

"HRC: Below is an oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook.Unfortunately they give it a horrible title but I think the piece turned out alright.Best SandyBy Samuel R. BergerSamuel R. Berger chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group served as national security advisor toPresident Clinton from 1997 to 2001.President Obama's National Security Strategy released by the White House on Thursday tackles a delicate butunavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home anda reordering of political power abroad?For some time now it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. TheSeptember 11 attacks global economic crisis cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulfunderscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America'smilitary supremacy is certainly not at risk new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club ofpowerful nations to the G-20 which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costsand benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats withoutothers nor should we bear the burden alone.Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience these congressionally mandated documents can easily becomelaborious and impenetrable or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge which President Clinton insisted upon tome and his other advisers is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informsadministration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action but a means to convey thepresident's principles and priorities.In Obama's case the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks withpast strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclearproliferation terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscalburden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America the administration makes a case for economicand technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Pointspeech last weekend. "At no time in human history" he said "has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintainedits military and political primacy."Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia thepresident has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening aglobal summit on securing nuclear material this spring Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effortstarted in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.On terrorism the strategy builds on the past but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton Bush and Obama each havedeployed all of America's tools: military power homeland defense law enforcement sanctions intelligence andvigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the GlobalWar on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. "This is not a global war against a tactic- terrorism - or a religion - Islam" the new strategy says. "We are at war with a specific network al-Qaeda and itsterrorist affiliates."This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world ensures the support of key allies who never accepted thebroader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan andturn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor the Obama administration has restored aless provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy President Bush articulated therationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores theprinciples that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort should weigh all thecosts and benefits and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right toact unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton oftendescribed as "together where possible alone where necessary."President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. ThePresident sets forth his rationale: "to create opportunities to resolve differences strengthen the internationalcommunity's support for our actions learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes and plainly demonstrateto the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation."In the case of Iran Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage havehelped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal tonegotiate.Without a doubt there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal ofdoubling exports in the next five years it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea Panama andColombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress but many of the true tests of this strategy lieahead.In the strategy's conclusions the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era calling for both political parties torestore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despitethe intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control Central America and d√©tente nearly all American supportedthe containment of communism.In that same spirit the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out ourdifferences over detention of prisoners methods to disarm dangerous states how hard to push for democratic rights orthe costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goalsspelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeedingin Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order ofenlightened self-interest economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.",0

("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")Compliments Of The Season 2006 Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise andmay offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent andwriting through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional data basefound in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity. After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact youamong other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe that God has a way of helping who is in need. I am (Godwin Amiri Esq)the Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we donÔøΩt want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.YourÔøΩs faithfullyGodwin Amiri (Esq.)FROM (ADB) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.GOD BLESSINGSPROTECTIONS AND GUIDIANCE TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very_________________________________________________________________Testez Windows Llive Mail Beta ! http://www.msn.frewhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f",1

"My name is Edward I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25THJULY2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] withthe whole passengers on board.During the course of my auditing work with my client bank I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death I further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knowsabout this account or anything concerning it the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company.The total amount involved is $36000000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10000000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without anydisappointment from your side we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary ofthe fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred.The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount inhis or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.Upon the receipt of your reply I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.",1

""Hello Sir/Madam firstly I will like to introduce my self to you well IÔøΩm Angelo Mai I work with a livestock company here in London I am looking for a dependable individual that I can trust someone who will be wiling and honest enough to carry out this transaction with deligent to the best of his/her ability. There has been a high level of demand in our company for a particular vaccine of farm animals which is mainly found in Malaysia this particular vaccine is called BOSSOMITE OIL 5000 I.U This product has been prove to be the best here in London for the rearing of farm animals and veterinary home the secret of this transaction is that my company has gotten absolutely no idea of the dealers and the price at which it's been sold over there in Malaysia. I once had a contact before in Malaysia Mr. Wong before this time we usually get this product from Germany at the equivalent price of $4300 USD I personally carried out a research on my own and got to find out that this product was right in Malaysia at a more affordable rate and of the same quality and activeness like that of GermanyÔøΩs. It was selling at the rate of 5500 Malaysian dollars ($1510.00USD) per carton it was very attractive and interesting so I had to seek for the assistant of Mr. Wong who I also met on the Internet we both agreed that it should be sold at the price of 11500 Malaysia dollars (equivalent $3157.23USD) per carton so I then introduce my company to Malaysia. Mr. Wong did this transaction with me just once using his capital and bought this product from the real supplier at the low price and making supplies to my boss at our agreed price. But to my greatest surprise Mr. Wong sent me ÔøΩ (quarter) of agreed percentage however I call to know what was going on but he promise to sent me the balance on a specifies date which he never turn up to. I was so sad but it was to me a helpless situation due to the fact that I was not been able to go to Malaysia my self except for my boss so I had to give up on him. How ever my company is making plans for another purchase so my idea and interest is for you to take the place of the real supplier and maintain my companyÔøΩs purchase price of 11500 Malaysia dollars at which my boss has bought before as it will be a continues transaction. The mode of this transaction is Cash at the point of delivery on the note of your wiliness to assist in facilitating this transaction on your own using your capital we shall both come to a compromise to determine our own terms of percentage all that is required in this transaction is for you to be purchasing this product from the real dealers at the good rate of 5500 Malaysia Dollars while making sales to my boss at the rate of 11500 Malaysia Dollars taking the place of the real supplier after which we will both make our profit from the interest which is suppose to go to the dealers. Perhaps we could agree on a 60/40 Percentage 60% for you and 40% for me respectively if ok by you. Your reply is of great important all information needed is intact and all that matters now is your respond. I hope to hear from you soon. Regards Angelo Mai --------------------------------- Yahoo!

"FROM THE DESK OF:MR XIAO GANGBANK OF OVERSEAS CHINESETAIPEITAIWANDear FriendHow are you today and business in your country? I am Mr.Xiao Gang Bank ManagerBank Of Overseas Chinese North Shyn Lin District Taipei Taiwan. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be wondering why I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you to read on.In November 1998 a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation Mr. Mark Kogan made a Fixed Deposit of the sum of US$10000000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which accumulated to the sum of US$20160176.00 (Twenty Million One hundred and sixty thousand One hundred and seventy six United States Dollars for twelve calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in America and Britain but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Mark Kogan died alongside his wife from an airplane crash. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care in this case; Mr. Mark Kogan died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. This sum of US$20160176.00 has since been sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Laws of Republic of China at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$20160176.00 deposited in my bank I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased which I shall provide you with is presented. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of overseas chinese is concerned the bank's management has no single idea of what=92s the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man=92s family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. mark kogan so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary authentication approval and a letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be done. A bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share 90/10.I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do I do not find against good conscience this may be hard for you to understand but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and i wont let it pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. There is no risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested in this lucrative role I urge you to indicate to that effect.

"See below....Nelson to support Don't Ask Don't Tell measure. Spoke with Byrd's people too....they think he is leaning tosupport it but would know for sure later today.Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repealBy: Jen DiMascioMay 26 2010 12:08 PM EDTNebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell likely putting repeal proponents over the top intheir quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military."I don't believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to bedeceptive and to lie. The 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy does just that" Nelson said. "It also encourages suspicion andsenior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity this policy encourages deceit.""I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of therepeal on the Pentagon's review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with militaryreadiness and effectiveness and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes" hesaid adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue."He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed he can live with this compromise" Nelson said.Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they too willvote for repeal Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defenseauthorization bill.Their decisions were also made after earlier news this week that both the White House and Gates could live with acompromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Pa.)."We thank Senator Nelson for his support and are extremely grateful. He and other senators supporting repeal will beon the right side of history" said Joe Solmonese president of the Human Rights Campaign. "While Senator Nelson's voteis critical no vote will be taken for granted in these final hours before the Senate committee vote."",0

"sbwhoeopTuesday February 16 2010 8:40 AMH: FYI: Les Gelb. SReplace Rahmby Leslie H. GelbFebruary 15 2010 I 10:48pmI ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup tosave his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm dump Larry Summers and get ridof National Security adviser Jim Jones.The negative even dismissive talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president mustchange key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly amatter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with provenrecords of getting things done in Washington and the world.To be fair it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities practicalities and steadiness come from Mr. Obama orhis White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking farbeyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president and exceptfor the right-wing crazies most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped. Soit is they who've got to go.It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go.One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere‚Äîandespecially in Washington‚Äîthat doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints isalways the same:‚Ä¢ Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently he said he did not "begrudge" WallStreeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This in the face of his saying only a couple ofweeks ago that such big bonuses were "shameful."‚Ä¢ Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East he recently said that "I think it is absolutely truethat what we did this year didn't produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted and if we had anticipated some ofthese political problems on both sides earlier we might not have raised expectations as high." He had to be totally out of itnot to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.‚Ä¢ Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn't recognize real opposition when he sees it‚Äîlet alone knowhow to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says heis "an eternal optimist‚Äîwhen those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any commonground and believe the administration has to "scrap the bill and start over."‚Ä¢ It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a "war of necessity" and orders more than 30000new troops there coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus only to seesome of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't.I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times Edward Luceprovided a thunderclap on Washington's negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna's Chicago-laden team.Luce named names in the White House and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story.They were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons author of The Washington Note essentiallyeridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious asit was during the Carter administration. There two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and JodyPowell‚Äîmoved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. Andthey were quite naturally too busy to learn. They also added to the "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders andbureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations.The Chicagoans and others "guarding" the president create their own "us versus them" world. It's hard to imagine a policyconversation between the president and the Chicago crowd since none of them except Rahm Emanuel has Washingtonor policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the presidenton a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First remove Rahm Emanuel as chiefof staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills anddiscipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and thetime to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles president of the Universityof North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta now CIA director and formerly White House chief as wellunder Clinton; Sylvia Mathews a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta another formerClinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.Replace Lawrence Summers director of the White House's National Economic Council with Paul Volcker the formerchairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to wantout anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature practical experience and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in aposition to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others withproven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert formerly head of OppenheimerVincent Mai former leader of AEA Investors and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars inWashington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair chairwoman of the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation and Elizabeth Warren chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above allwould help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson accomplished businessman andpolicy head.David Axelrod the senior political adviser to the president needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaignwherein his expertise lies and not on domestic and foreign policy where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice.Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle theformer Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe another senior campaign aide now in unofficialresidence at the White House he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicagobuddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move but she should be given a more limited role in makingpolicy.Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice but not nearlyenough.Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithyRepublicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possiblesuccessors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times Jake Tapper of ABC News or Helene Cooper of The New YorkTimes.Last but not least James Jones the National Security Adviser has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admiredand respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But bywide acclamation inside and outside the White House he has not emerged as a strategist‚Äîperhaps the key requirementof this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together‚Äîlaying out achievable objectives and preciseplans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now despite his age isZbigniew Brzezinski Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind‚Äîa rare quality‚Äîandknows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform theNational Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try formerambassadors Thomas Pickering Morton Abramowitz Frank Wisner Reginald Bartholomew and Winston Lord. Theyhave it all. At a minimum they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama onstrategy.Yes many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They allpossess the necessary energy experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a criticalbonus they could and would mentor the next generation down a very talented one indeed to succeed them in two orthree years. To lead America and the world Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems asintellectual puzzles‚Äîto collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition insensing what's achievable which buttons to push when how to buy the time for power to take hold how to makeadjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric how to avoid failures that only diminish power and how to succeed in smallas well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills President Obama and America would succeed.Leslie H. Gelb a former New York Times columnist and senior government official is author of powerRule5-.

"FYI:USIBC Launches New Education Initiative to Strengthen K-12 Vocational and Higher Education Linkages in the U.S. andIndiaJune 2 2010 - Washington DC - On the occasion of its 35th anniversary and looking ahead to the global economy ofthe future the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) today announced the launch of a new initiative aimed atstrengthening institutional linkages between academia industry and NGOs focusing on the elementary vocational andhigher education sectors in both countries."The United States and India must be committed partners in building the workforce of tomorrow a partnership that willunleash opportunity spur growth and sustain prosperity not just in our countries but across the global community" saidHarold McGraw III incoming USIBC Chairman and Chairman President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. "To dothis we must focus on strengthening our educational ties at every level. By working together our two countries canequip the next generation with the education and skills necessary to compete and win in the global economy."Mr. McGraw gave the keynote address before a packed audience of over 400 U.S. and Indian business government andeducation leaders at USIBC's 35th Anniversary Summit entitled "A Pivotal Period in U.S.-India Relations: TacklingEducation Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth."On the eve of the first-ever U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue India's Union Minister of External Affairs SM Krishna U.S.Education Secretary Arne Duncan India's Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal and India's Ambassadorto the United States Meera Shankar joined hundreds of top business leaders in Washington to participate in the U.S.-India Business Council 35th anniversary deliberations.USIBC's Education Initiative will serve as a dynamic platform for business NGOs and academia to provide vital input intoboth the U.S. and Indian governments - such that the synergies between American and Indian business and educationalcommunities are unleashed."We can talk about strategic defense civil nuclear renewable energy and every other type of commercial cooperationbut if we do not develop the skill sets in our respective societies to sustain such collaboration all this talk will never besuccessfully converted to action" Ron Somers President of the U.S.-India Business Council noted. "How fortunate it isthat families across all walks of life in both our societies so highly value education. We have much to learn from oneanother and much to accomplish - to prepare for the challenges of the 21st Century" Somers said.The USIBC Education initiative will focus on three thrust areas:1.

"FROM THE DESK OF IBRAHIM MUSSABILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGERAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)OUAGADOUGOUBURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA.With Due RespectI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of african development bank (ADB). I crave your indulgence as i contact you in such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter carefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial rewards for both of us.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten MillionFive Hundred Thousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only  in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 in a plan crash. Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the plan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as "unclaimed fund". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account  10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank nameyour bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your replyI will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfullyibrahim mussaBill and exchange managerAfrican Development bank ADB_________________________________________________________________DÔøΩcouvrez Live.com : le nouveau moteur de recherche par Messenger! http://www.windowslive.fr/livecom/",1

"Mr. Jun ChengBank Of Korea16-1 Yoido-dong Youngdungpo-gu Seoul 150-873.Dear Friend I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the foreign remittance department of Hanivitbank. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $44700000.00 (Forty Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American who died along with his entire family on November 1996 in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the information about his death we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately nobody has come forward to claim this money. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account. Now it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004 when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance is occasioned by the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips. The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account shall be 70% to my colleagues and I for the role you will be expected to play in this deal we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Thereforeyou are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matterto enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch.

"TRANSFER OF 36759000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOURACCOUNT.My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However this correspondence is unofficial and private and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER a program leader.Until his deathThe Late PrimeMinister Mr. Rafik Hariri has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1 1944 - February 14 2005) married to Nazek Audi Hariri was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 202004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital for more information please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/)I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.Best Regards Mr.Jason Leicester .",1
"I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha from Kuwait. I am married to Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million five hundred dollars) which he inherited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently this money is still with finance and security firm. Recently my doctor told me that I had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next four months. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches orphanages widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of alms charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with God the highest and the most merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of my lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this letter and accept to assist me to conclude this transaction if you want to speak with me he will arrange for that because my doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly I can't discuss in the presence ofmy husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the hospital my lawyer is the only person that knows the decision that I am taking.With God I know that all things are possible and as soon as I receive your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact of thefinance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though married to a Muslim whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in spirit please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in souring for another Christianorganization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders may the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

"last military regime in Nigeria government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25500000.00 (Twenty Five million five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account if you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you).

"Mr. Jun ChengBank Of Korea16-1 Yoido-dong Youngdungpo-gu Seoul 150-873.Dear Friend I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the foreign remittance department of Hanivitbank. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $44700000.00 (Forty Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American who died along with his entire family on November 1996 in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the information about his death we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately nobody has come forward to claim this money. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account. Now it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004 when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance is occasioned by the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips. The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account shall be 70% to my colleagues and I for the role you will be expected to play in this deal we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Thereforeyou are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matterto enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.Personal RegardsMr. Jun Cheng___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent to Webmaster.- http://www.1stpd.net",1

"UUP policing meeting with McGuinness breaksdown after three minutesLatest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfast‚Ä¢ Henry McDonald Ireland correspondent‚Ä¢ quardian.co.uk Monday 8 March 2010 17.36 GMT‚Ä¢ Article historyA meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Ireland's deputy first minister aimed at securing the party's supportfor the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening.The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont.The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powersfrom London to Belfast. The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entirepower-sharing executive is dysfunctional.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powersunless it obtained concessions on education ‚Äî specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11.Following the aborted meeting today the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinsonthe first minister who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from thedeputy first minister's office.A UUP spokesman said: "An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist partyon policing and justice. He ridiculously accused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded thedeputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont."Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein ‚Äî unfortunately for Mr McGuinness a party votingagainst a motion with which it disagrees is basic normal democratic politics."The spokesman added that McGuinness's "angry and aggressive attempt to lecture" the UUP was "wholly unacceptable"."When challenged on his tone the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolutionfrom Martin McGuinness."If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive isdysfunctional."If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist non-sectarian Allianceparty David Ford will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland.The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. However the nationalist party isangry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power-sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry.The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as theywant to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement.US Congress warns Cameron over danger offailed Ulster police dealYes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month‚Ä¢ Nicholas Watt chief political correspondent‚Ä¢ guardian.co.uk Sunday 7 March 2010 22.12 GMT‚Ä¢ Article historyUS secretary of state Hillary Clinton is said to be concerned at Cameron's apparent failure to exert pressure on his UUPpartners. Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesDavid Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be "emboldened" to intensifytheir attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade theTories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of US Congressmembers have demanded Cameron must "aggressively" encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in theNorthern Ireland assembly on Tuesday."At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about theirshared future" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.Without a unanimous vote they said the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the peoplethey represent and to the world."Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will continue to beemboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of bringing good jobs toNorthern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability."The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the Guardianbefore the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists.A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British governmenthas dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state Hillary Clintonwrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing thedeal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warn the UUP of the dangers ofobstructing the deal.A Tory source said: "David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminaljustice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are for the parties in theexecutive working as a four-party coalition to decide. We hope that between now and Tuesday any outstanding issuescan be solved."The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest partyin Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist and Unionistcommunities and 50% of the assembly.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement will meet his party'sexecutive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly membersaccount for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP seen as amoribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it would destabilise many members of the DUP and underminesupport for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.US eyes on Northern Ireland in countdown tocrucial peace voteHillary Clinton the White House and Congressional leaders look for a yes vote in BelfastBy Nick WattGuardianFor a few hours tomorrow the United States will turn its attention to Northern Ireland. Democratic and Republican leaderswill both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of theGood Friday Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.Sir Reg Empey the leader of the Ulster Unionist party is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes.Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policingand criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month ‚Äî a key nationalist demand ‚Äî in return for the long-standingunionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run.Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. Hillary Clinton the US secretary of state who has taken a keeninterest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband's presidency spent15 minutes talking to Empey by phone according to BBC Northern Ireland.But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that agroup of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP whichrecently formed an electoral pact with the Tories to vote yes.The unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would bewell advised to follow the example of John Major who was respected as an impartial referee.The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William Hague. The shadow foreignsecretary is saying that despite their political differences he is forging a strong bond with Clinton.But all sides need to be careful. The Tories who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP believe that ministersneed to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morningtrumpeting a poll commissioned by them which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But asSlugger O'Toole notes there is some debate about the methodology."It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Brown's beloved dividinglines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong" one Tory tells me.",0

"sbwhoeopSaturday September 11 2010 2:20 PMH: On NYT website within last hour in tomorrow's paper. Paid TV ads please. SidSeptember 112010G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to LobbyistsBy ERIC LIPTONWASHINGTON ‚Äî House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatoryoverhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industrylobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Streetlobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least waterit down."We need you to get out there and speak up against this" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon according to threepeople familiar with his remarks while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.That sort of alliance ‚Äî they won a few skirmishes though they lost the war on the regulatory bill ‚Äî is business as usualfor Mr. Boehner the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. Hemaintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggestbusinesses including Goldman Sachs Google Citigroup R. J. Reynolds MillerCoors and UPS.They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years provided him rides on theircorporate jets socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts forhis Boehner for Speaker campaign which is soliciting checks of up to $37800 each the maximum allowed.Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help ‚Äî calling the congressman and his aides asoften as several times a week ‚Äî to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases Mr. Boehner has helpedthem out.As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party ‚Äî President Obamamentioned his name eight times in a speech last week ‚Äî and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible his ties to lobbyistscultivated since he arrived here in 1991 are coming under attack.The woman he hopes to replace Speaker Nancy Pelosi derided him on Friday as having met "countless times withspecial-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee through a spokeswoman charged that he "epitomizes thesmoked-filled backroom special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington."Mr. Boehner who declined to be interviewed for this article and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politicallymotivated by desperate Democrats. His actions they say simply reflect the pro-business antiregulatory philosophy thathe has espoused for more than three decades dating back to when Mr. Boehner the son of a tavern owner ran a smallplastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual he says."I get lobbied every day by somebody" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. "It could be by my wife. It could bethe bellman. It goes on all day everyday everyplace."Mr. Boehner ‚Äî a 60-year-old perpetually tanned sharply tailored chain-smoking golfer ‚Äî is not as fiery as NewtGingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is hisreputation as a "Chamber of Commerce" Republican and his fund-raising skills ‚Äî he has raised $36 million forRepublican causes during this election cycle more than almost anyone else in his party ‚Äî that explain in part his rise.If elected as his party's leader in the House Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he buildscoalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrongwith that."Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes absolutely" said Mark lsakowitz a friend whose Republican firmrepresents more than three dozen financial telecommunications energy and consumer products companies as diverseas Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. "But I think all the good lawmakers do."Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobaccolobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican Mr. Boehner said he hadbroken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed theThursday Group a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party'slegislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadershipposition.But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and theWorkforce Committee and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regularsalong with some newcomers are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matterswrite checks to his campaign and socialize with him.That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio aCitigroup lobbyist; and two former aides Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig both now financial services lobbyists.The tobacco industry is particularly well represented with both Mr. Gates and John Fish a lobbyist for R. J. Reynoldsmaker of Camel cigarettes in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340000 to Mr.Boehner's political campaigns with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner'spolitical career according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporateinterests Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill Boehner Land. Themembers of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff."He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it" said Drew Maloney alobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. "That is how you get things done."One lobbyist in the club ‚Äî after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help ‚Äîticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oilindustry fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a capon greenhouse gas emissions.Still with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority they often lost the fights.But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.From 2000 to 2007 Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times often with his wife Debbie on corporate jets provided bycompanies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)In addition over the last decade he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups often topopular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel which has recently beencurbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab although now it is paid forthrough his political action committee the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months it has spent at least $67000 at the RitzCarlton Naples in Florida at least $20000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville Va. and at least $29000 atthe Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin Ohio federal records show for fund-raising events.In June with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-raising effort starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to drawlarge donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.He turned again to the same group of lobbyists former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of theRepublican National Committee."The wave is there there is a rebellion in the country and we have good candidates" Mr. Boehner told his supportersone of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. "But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity becausewe have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money."Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far a party spokesman said the campaign has raisednearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidatesacross the country and the party appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks like "meetings withLeader Boehner and much much more."But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much because they already had plenty ofaccess to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House."He knows this is going to be a tough election" said Samuel J. Baptista a friend golf partner and lobbyist whose clientsinclude Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. "But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril."",0

I am (Ben Coroma Esq)asenior staff in file departme=nt in African developent bank (ADB).I gotyour contact from a tourist from= your country who was in this country and transacted a business with our =bank. When i was searching for aforeign partner i assured of your capabil=ity and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed t=o God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum =of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an acc=ount that belongs to one ofour foreign customer who died along with his =entire family in Monday 31st July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got inf=ormation about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come =over and claim hismoney because we can not release it unless somebody app=lies for it asnext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our= banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed ne=xt ofkin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving =nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my departme=nt now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mon=ey to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and s=ubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t want th=is money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law =and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years the money will be transfered into the= Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin= in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a forei=gner and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We agree= that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner in respect to= the provision of a foreign account 10 % will be set aside for expenses =incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleag=ue. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disburseme=nt according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer ofthis fund to you as arrange=d you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of the dec=eased indicating your bank name yourbank account number your private te=lephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location =where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or emailthe text of= the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transa=ction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear a=s all required arrangements have been made forthetransfer. You should contact me on this email (00226-7885 7597)immediately as soon =as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear fromyou immediately. Your's faithfully Ben Coroma (Esq.) POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer= to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As yo=u finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss ver=y well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received =my mail because i don't go to net always.

Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respectiveroles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clintonfor proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORKSECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTONSpeaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:"After years of war and uncertainty people are wondering what the future holds at home and abroad. So let me sayit clearly: The United States can must and will lead in this new century."Ironically two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president andthe ex-would-be-president the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.Except that these days both Clintons are more influential and more beloved than ever. Bill's Clinton GlobalInitiative is starting to feel like a sexier more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itselfbringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based technocraticsolutions. As of this summer his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort torebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president and hespent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.Meanwhile Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States anaccolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin'stemper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions promoting women's rights over theobjections of entrenched traditionalists and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world'spoorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence with her Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment Review a major if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this iswhat Clinton nostalgia looks like bring it on.74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughterfor setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTONBarack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how theUnited States deals with its allies and enemies abroad and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes felllargely to two people in particular. At the State Department Anne-Marie Slaughter director of policy planning isspearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenatemarginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development preparing for a world inwhich America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy co-founder of the Center for a NewAmerican Security think tank who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that bothcandidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's ownquadrennial review a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediateneeds posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistanstrategy albeit a pragmatic one: "I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy" she toldthe Senate in February. "We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better."Anne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Dept(silent of State(202) 647-2972",0

"Let me try this again.Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strongcorrelation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand strategyof off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version or at least an academic's version of the elevator version.What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller military due tobudget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to apply thisproposal to Afghanistan."An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America's core national securityobjectives through a combination of over-the-horizon ("off-shore") military power and in-region ("on-shore") economic andpolitical power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the deployment oflarge ground forces overseas already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic challenges continueand chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval air and rapidly deployable ground forcesin combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure America's interests in combatingterrorism and achieving other key national security goals particularly in the Middle East and Asia."AM",0

"Mr. Jun ChengBank Of Korea16-1 Yoido-dong Youngdungpo-gu Seoul 150-873.Dear Friend I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the foreign remittance department of Hanivitbank. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $44700000.00 (Forty Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American who died along with his entire family on November 1998 in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the information about his death we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately nobody has come forward to claim this money. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account. Now it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2005 when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance is occasioned by the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips. The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account shall be 70% to my colleagues and I for the role you will be expected to play in this deal we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Thereforeyou are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matterto enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.Personal RegardsMr. Jun Cheng___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site- http://www.sh35.h12.ru",1

"I've attached the gorgeous cover as a PDFHillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the WorldBy Joe KleinTime MagazineWednesday Nov. 04 2009It was Halloween night in Jerusalem and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. "We're prepared to startpeace talks immediately" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed with U.S. Secretary of State HillaryClinton standing at his side poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."It was a ploy of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves yet again. They had elections looming and theirleader Mahmoud Abbas had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the WestBank ‚Äî which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering apartial freeze not including new settlements in East Jerusalem the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This wasa nonstarter for the Palestinians but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offerNetanyahu trumpeted with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)It was a tough moment for Clinton playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama hadsoftened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze he had talked about Israeli"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat agreeing thatNetanyahu's proposal was indeed "unprecedented" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The mostimportant thing she added was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on thePalestinians ‚Äî and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arabneighbors soon joined in causing Clinton to backtrack two days later telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" ofU.S. expectations although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly Clinton had been too bullish onNetanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seenprivately by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talkswithout preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clintonhad violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of formerSecretary of State Madeleine Albright.)Clinton's Three QualitiesFor the past 40 years the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You goto Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private you try to move a comma but theIsraelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. Thebreakthroughs when they come emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go toJerusalem ... and Sadat to everyone's surprise says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo andreach what appears to be a breakthrough ‚Äî they're talking! ‚Äî which then becomes another dead end.The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways the Department of State a noble antiqueis still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rulesdiplomacy moves at the speed and requires the nuanced complexity of literature. Power has drifted from State to theNational Security Council and the Pentagon especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors havedistinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State wasRichard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; JamesBaker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others havebeen frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about ‚Äî the second most popular American inthe world an eternally compelling and supremely talented character the subject of constant speculation a walkingheadline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.It is a clich√© to say that by naming Clinton Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. Theconventional wisdom too cynical by half is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her a theory bolstered by Clinton'sreticence during her first nine months on the job with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing theheavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton Obama also gave her great power which cuts both ways: if shebecomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe ‚Äî the Iraq war ‚Äî but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe but as theObama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players the Powell conundrumlooms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?Traditionally the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy negotiate deals and manage thestriped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist although her performance in the 2008 campaignindicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonianidealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator ‚Äî although her performance in Jerusalemindicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.There are however three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision ofdepartmental reform ‚Äî the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy‚Äî that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold theoffice since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration which has enabled her to better understandand interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important she is aninternational celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability ‚Äî second only tothe President's ‚Äî to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time althoughher performance so far at home and abroad has occasionally been perplexing. At home she has often seemedtentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early OctoberClinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad she seemsfar more confident at times to the point of recklessness as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton'scampaign.)Independence and CandorIn the last week of October Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage attempting at thebehest of her special envoys to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.In the course of the trip there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting herindependence as the Administration facing roadblocks across the world struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone afteran opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King ‚Äî "Can't we all just get along?" ‚Äî phase.During her three days in Pakistan she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have beenunprecedented to use the word of the week for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip planned by Holbrooke and Pakistanspecialist Vali Nasr offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that hadbeen bombed by Sunni extremists for example sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. "Wesaw her praying there" an academic named Shala Aziz told me "and for the first time I'm thinking The Americans havehearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students talk-show hostsand Pashturi elders -- and that on occasion she pushed back raising incredibly sensitive issues like why no one in thePakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was even though he had been in the country since 2002. Pressaccounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton'sundiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticismhad begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy more interested in having thePakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrastwas especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of PervezMusharraf. "In the past when the Americans came they would talk to the generals and go home" said FarahnazIspahani a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone hostileor not has made a big impression ‚Äî and because she's Hillary Clinton with a real history of affinity for this country itmeans so much more."Transformative ExperienceThere are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements though andClinton's ‚Äî delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes ‚Äî was surprisingly emotional.Earlier in the day President Asif Ali Zardari the widower of Benazir Bhutto had presented the Secretary with an albumof photos from her first visit to Pakistan in 1995 and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton anddaughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then choking up but quickly pulled herself togethertalking about the "reasons why we do what we do ‚Äî to provide opportunities for all."Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her ‚Äî the beginning Ibelieve of the‚Ä¢process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; whenwe set off she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994congressional elections and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a verypersonal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan crowds shouted her down and cursed her.Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation ‚Äî it wasChelsea's spring break ‚Äî but also a retreat to a more demure First Lady‚Äìlike role after two years as health care policyczar although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famouslyridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs."That was the greatest trip just unbelievable" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after herJerusalem gaffe the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearingglasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I'vedone since" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated with a new mission. By the end of 1995 at the U.N.Conference on Women in Beijing the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women's rights are humanrights."(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 yearsof insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.When her husband was governor of Arkansas she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outsideBhutto's hotel waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwarkameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever didanything like that" Clinton says.When Clinton and Bhutto met formally on the first day of the 1995 trip they hit it off immediately in part becauseBhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember askingBhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years and she said "I used to be ableto walk down the street wearing jeans without a headscarf. Now I can't." When I asked her why she said ‚Äî bluntly ‚Äî"The Saudis" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course Bhutto's acquiescence to andparticipation in the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were soinadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)Ironically the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests ‚Äî microfinance education andhealth care ‚Äî to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the StateDepartment but from the military where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -schools justice economic development ‚Äî reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result therewas immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus author of the Army's counterinsurgencymanual who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Atone point well before Obama made his presidential intentions known I asked Petraeus if there was any potentialDemocratic candidate who understood how his mind worked and he said "You mean aside from Hillary?"It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males" she calls them) for the first time -at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for themilitary while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught thanusual ‚Äî although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. Infact relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother at times than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAIDdirector Paul Farmer from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things" says a Clinton adviser "like Farmer hadat one point brought more than $10000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program but theamount was illegal."Another of Clinton's military mentors retired General Jack Keane once told me "I'm a Republican. I disagree with herabout practically everything but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to thewoman a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpestexchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bushafter she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tonehas been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israelisettlement freeze by claiming in May that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements notoutposts not natural-growth exceptions." And then in Jerusalem her use of the word unprecedented seemed arhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton's Collateral Damage.")The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several stepsremoved from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult as always:whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister the Israeli stands up and walks out ofthe room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary tactical enthusiasm for peace talks his Likud Party has always favored thede facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.Hillary's ChoiceThe tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are insubstantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues ‚Äî although neither iswilling to disclose the content of their private conversations ‚Äî but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growingperception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess Iran seemsready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations there's no progress in the Middle East the Syrians and North Koreans remainrecalcitrant the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense and the Chinese have been given a pass onhuman rights with no apparent quid pro quos.The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive and North Korea has said it willreturn to the six-party talks. Clinton argues correctly about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obamareally has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and ‚Äî no small thing ‚Äî the wisdom to haverefrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness ‚Äî but thisAdministration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happenovernight but for Obama's policies to be considered a success it has to happen sooner or later in a way that can beexplained to the public.There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show ‚Äî not in his overall policy whichrepresents the views of a broad moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry butin his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peacehunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;if it doesn't it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it isaccompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can't be seen pushing countries around ‚Äî demanding[that] Israel freeze settlements demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government ‚Äî and not get results" says LeslieH. Gelb author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough successful politicians and they'll begin to takeyou less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praisefor the President is fulsome and aides say the relationship with Obama really ‚Äî really ‚Äî is strong. But there are alsoburblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends Foggy Bottom body language that suggest there is a need forthe Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by theuncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication thatthe Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship ‚Äî or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of NewYork as has been rumored. Quite the contrary she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do thatthough she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President'sprimary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration seven different Obama officialshave spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Eitheryou have one person sending the foreign policy message with the clear approval of the President" says a formerRepublican Secretary of State "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed Clinton's staff acknowledgedthat she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately though televisionis a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals ‚Äî both extremelyguarded and private people ‚Äî really trust each other; and if not Clinton who will emerge as the President's alter egoon foreign policy? At this point the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates ‚Äî but he's aRepublican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Joneshas settled in as National Security Adviser but he's not a political animal ‚Äî and every President needs a close foreignpolicy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy politics and diplomatic chess.Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioningthe $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage controlhave you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari a television-news-show host at the end of Clinton'smeeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don't know" shesaid. "I hope some."Afterward I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well this trip was long overdue" she said. "The Pakistanipeople really needed to talk to an American about our concerns ‚Äî the strings attached to aid programs the droneattacks their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about thedamage control" ‚Äî she paused thinking it through ‚Äî "I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."In the end though Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and most important a trusted adviser to a President whoknows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.",0

Note last sentence about action by "US Authorities"Press Information BureauGovernment of IndiaMinistry of Home Affairs09-September-2010 11:44 1STHome Minister Appeals to Media to Help Maintain Communal Harmony in View of U.S. PastorThreatening to Burn QuranThe Union Home Minister Slui P.Chidambaram has appealed to media to help maintain communal peace andharmony in the wake of reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the holy Quran. In astatement issued here today the Union Home Minister said that the act is calculated to increase strife betweendifferent religious groups. Following is the text of his statement :"There are reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the Quran on September 11 2010.The US authorities have strongly condemned the statement of the pastor. Religious leaders all over the worldhave also condemned his proposed action.We condemn the action of the pastor. It is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion. Itis obviously calculated to increase bitterness and strife between different religious groups. No one who isinterested in maintaining harmony and peace among different sections of the people can condone such action.We hope that the US authorities will take strong action to prevent such an outrage being committed.While we await the action of the US authorities we would appeal to the media in India ‚Äî both print andvisual media ‚Äî to refrain from telecasting visuals or publishing photographs of the deplorable act. Wewould also appeal to the media to exercise great restraint over the next couple of days and help inmaintaining communal peace and harmony."OK/KSIndia Condemns U.S. Pastor's Plan to Burn the Quran UrgesMedia RestraintBy Bibhudatta Pradhan - Sep 9 2010India "condemns" a plan by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran and the government hopes the U.S. willtake strong action against him Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi.Terry Jones pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville has been criticized by U.S. Secretary ofState Hillary Clinton and the Vatican for his plan to burn the Muslim holy book on Sept. 11. General DavidPetraeus commander of international coalition forces in Afghanistan said the act would endanger U.S. troops.Chidambaram urged Indian newspapers not to publish photographs of what he said would be a "deplorable act"and asked television channels to refrain from broadcasting images. The media must show restraint over the"next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony" the minister said reading agovernment statement.The proposed burning "is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion" Chidambaramsaid.

"99 35<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dear Sir/Madam<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now <BR>decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside <BR>marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud AlkharjÔøΩs property for her <BR>and her son.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>You must be asking where I got your mail address it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running if you are interested to assist us all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing <BR>you as the only beneficiary.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not <BR>permanently resident in Switzerland.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>For your assistance we made up of I 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank <BR>funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are <BR>concerned as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you are okay with the above explanations you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine after which we will make more information available to you on how we will <BR>proceed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at <A href="http://www.royaltrust.com">www.royaltrust.com</A>.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>We await your timely response.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Best Regards<BR>&nbsp;<BR>DR PETER CLAPTON<BR></BODY></HTML>--= Multipart Boundary 1030031655--",1

"" accident. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>On further investigation I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25000000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;According to the Ghanaian Law at the expiration of 7{Seven} years the money will revert to the ownership of the Ghana Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(2) We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your name for the transfer.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>(3) A bank account in any part of the world which you provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin of Mr.Barry Kelly. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>If you are interested please call :00233-242-9727-02. or reply immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand.

"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTIONAFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASOWEST AFRICA.Attention PleaseI am Musa Garuba the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million eighty five thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker)we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please you have been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communicationYours faithfullyMusa Garuba._________________________________________________________________Testez Windows Live Mail Beta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/",1

Biofuel is a renewable energy source unlike other natural resources such as petroleum coal and nuclear fuels. Agricultural products specifically grown for use as biofuels include corn and soybeans.Extensive research is currently being conducted to determine the utilization of microalgae as an energy source with applications being developed for biodiesel ethanol methanol methane and even hydrogen. Independent studies have demonstrated that algae is capable of producing 30 times more oil per acre than the current crops now utilized for the production of biofuels. Algae biofuel contains no sulfur is non-toxic and highly biodegradable.The Office of Fuels Development a division of the Department of Energy funded a program from 1978 through 1996 under the National Renewable Energy Laboratory known as the "Aquatic Species Program." The focus of this program was to investigate high-oil algae that could be grown specifically for the purpose of wide-scale biodiesel production. Some species of algae are ideally suited to biodiesel production due to their high oil content in excess of 50% and extremely rapid growth rates.One of the biggest advantages of biodiesel compared to many other alternative transportation fuels is that it can be used in existing diesel engines which relieves automotive manufacturers of having to make costly engine modifications. Biodiesel can also be mixed at any ratio with conventional petroleum diesel. As a result the alternative fuel can be used in the current distribution infrastructure replacing petroleum diesel either wholly or as a diesel fuel blend with minimal integration costs.About PetroSunPetroSun's current operations are concentrated in the Ark-La-Tex region with plans to expand into New Mexico Arizona Utah and Australia in 2006. PetroSun provides a comprehensive array of products and services to the oil industry. The company's cutting-edge technologies combined with a proven ability to apply them effectively and safely within a disciplined ROI framework creates long-term value for PetroSun shareholders and partners.

"FYI Gary Sick's latest analysis on Iran below (posted on his blog). Sick has independent sources andis very well informed.June 17 2009Is this another Iranian revolution?To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination developmentsin Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets oftenmarching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faceddetermined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants andritual calls of "Down with the shah!"; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar.You need only change "shah" to "dictator" and you have a description of what is happening in Irantoday.But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago Iran had a charismatic cleric named AyatollahKhomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause herepresented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah who had been on the throne for some 37years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On thesurface it appeared to be an uneven battle ‚Äî guns against turbans ‚Äî but the ruler with the guns waveredand the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed.Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical Mir Hossein Mousavi who isnotably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader AyatollahIChamene' i who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for hisreligious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political systemand the institutions most loyal to him ‚Äî particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerfulsecurity forces including the Revolutionary Guards.Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces let alone the situation. Thefraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event but the energy behind these unprecedenteddemonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers bythe regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that peoplestay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter offormer president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then "ordered" everyone tomarch the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders).IChamene'i announced the "divine assessment" of the election outcome ‚Äî even before it would probablyhave been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then in the face of mass protestshe ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council‚Äî the same organization that wasresponsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case and no oneexpected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace andreconciliation. No one paid any attention.I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his "victory" he went offto a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passiveplayer than a major actor in these events.So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd not leading it. But that isprobably all that is required to keep the protest in motion.On the other side the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being madeby the ultra-conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards whose political role has ballooned overthe past decade perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterlyruthless and ideologically fueled.New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on June 15 below)at the end of the day as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago when Might and Right do battle it's often prudentto bet on Might at least in the short run.The regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup ‚Äî theannouncement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force ‚Äî would intimidate and silence theopposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were beingmade by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms rather than politicians such asIChamene'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event it b ackfired and they now have amuch larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slimmargin (which was at least believable).All parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to haveconcluded that their social contract with the rulers ‚Äî accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectfulregard for the opinion of the governed an Islamic Republic ‚Äî is no longer valid. They do not trust theirrulers.The rulers whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of thecountry are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have calledthat tactic into question. For the military the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear tobe a moment to bet on Might.But nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and coulddetermine the future path of the Iranian revolution.There is another lesson as Iran's leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmencrackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago one of the leaders of China at the time was ZhaoZiyang General Secretary of the Communist Party. He was later fired and placed under house arrest.His smuggled memoirs have just appeared revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dershipabout how to proceed.Is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one canonly presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic Republic of Iran?Dell Days of Deals!

"Below is the Iran section of the chair's statement from Trieste. There is strong language on human rights; is that whatMiliband was referring to? The language on the nuclear issue reflects where we were last summer -- still on the firsttrack.IranWe are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At thesame time we deplore post-electoral violence which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidaritywith those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental humanrights including freedom of expression as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should besettled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iraniangovernment to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran's nuclear program and support renewedefforts to that effect such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China FranceGermany Russia the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations as well as the constructiveinvolvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. Wesincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to thenuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Iran's nuclear programme.We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme but that comes with the responsibility to restoreconfidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. We strongly urge Iran to cooperate fully with theIAEA and to comply with the relevant UNSC Resolutions.Our meeting on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly opening week next September will be an occasionfor the G8 to take stock of the situation.",0

">From Mrs. Elena OwenLondon W8 5DL4 Kensington CourtEngland.I am Mrs. Elena Owen a citizen of Bulgaria but I based in England I am married to Sir Francis Owen who also is an Englishman though dead now. My husband worked with the British Railways for over two decade before the cold hand of death took him away on the 3rd of June 2005 at about 2:00AM our marriage lasted for over a decade without any fruit of the womb.My husband died after a protracted illness. My husband and I made a vow to uplift the down-trodden and the less-privileged individuals within the Europe North and South America Africa and the rest of the Globe as he had passion for persons who cannot help hemselves due to physical disability or financial predicament. I can adduce this to the fact that he needed a Child from this relationship which never came.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $10.5 Million (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars in a dormant Account in one of the leading security and Finance company in Europe. this money is still with the Finance Company. Presently am suffering from cancerous ailment for some years now. Recently my Doctor told me that I have a limited or numbered days on earth and that my life Spam will not exceed 150days due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from.Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer. With this hard reality that has befallen my family I have decided to donate this fund to a non-governmental or better still an individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. that will use this gift which comes from my husbands sweat to fund the upkeep of widows orphans destitute the down-trodden physically challenged children barren-women and persons who prove to be genuinely handicapped financially. It is often said that blessed is the hand that gives.I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are Bourgeois and very wealthy persons and I do not want my husband hard earned money to be misused by his relatives whom have already sold all his landed property. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be with the Almighty when I eventually pass on.The Almighty will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I do not need any telephone communication in this regard due to my deteriorating health and because of the presence of my husband relatives around me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. I will want you to contact my personal attorney base in Manchester (U.K) on the information stated below whom I have entrusted every detail regarding this fund.",1

"URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSALI am Mr.PAULSON BENSON the elder son of late Mr.JAMES BENSON of Zimbabwe. I got your contactaddress from the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry please don't worry. During the currentcrises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in my country he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. My father was one of the biggest farmers in the country and although a black indegene he did not support the President?s political ideology.Therefore the president?s supporters invaded my father?s farm burnt down everything killed him and confiscated all his investments. After the death of my fathermy mother and I together with my younger brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of ourlives. On our departure from Zimbabwewe took along with us some money which my father kept in thesafe in my mother?s custody which amounted to the sum of US$15000000.00 (FIFTEENMILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) to the Republic of South Africa where we have deposited it aspersonal valuables in a private security company and sought for political asylum. My mother has suggested and I agree that we have to further move out of the African continent to overseas for actual safety and to do reliable business investments.Therefore we have decided that I should contact any reliable overseas person/firm/company who could assist us to transfer this money out of South Africa through a current investment account because asrefugees we are not allowed to operate any account exceeding US$2000(Two Thousand US Dollars).So we need your help to come down to South Africa to open a bank account through which we cantransfer this money to your country.If my proposal is considered for assisting us to Transfer this money to your country we unanimously agree to offer you 20% of the total fund5% will be for any expenses that may be incuured during thetransaction 75% will be for me and my family to invest in your country under your assistance.",1

"Greetings from the beautiful land of Zimbabwe.I am Joseph Made of Lands Agriculture & Rural Resettlement ministry ofZimbabwe.As a member of cabinet and former stuanch supporter of President Mugabe'sgovernment I was opportuned to be in the know as to what led to thestruggle for farm lands and subsequent fall out of my government with theWestern world. As of today I would be more than glad if the case of whathappened can be reversed as I have come to see that it was all in pursuitof the selfish interest of one man the president!After all said and done it has become obvious that my president like anyother African leaders needed to make sure that he remains in power to notjust consolidate his fortunes but also to make sure that he bleeds thecountry to death by siphoning the money meant for developmentalinfrastrure abroad. Of course with the help of some foreigners who do notsee anythng wrong in helping him steal the country blind. I may very well be sounding like a disgruntled and dis-appointed personbut the truth is that he has shifted his gaze from the foreigners to hisown very people. He sees any suggestions or opinions that does not agreewith his own has been that of a sabortuer and the person therefore mustbe purnished. In other words we the followers have come to realise thathe feels threatened by not just our presence but coupled with the factthat most of us are privy to what transpired and are very much aware ofthe movement of large sums of money abroad.As it stands now I and many others are of the strong opinion that sooneror later it will be our turn to be flushed out of the composition ofmembers of cabinet and replaced with loyals who obviously have sworn to anoath of allegiance and loyalty via fetish and ritualistic methods. Thisbeing the norm does not appeal to some of us and therefore we are nowtargets to be dismissed/disgraced from service or face possibleextermination.I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with youthe possibility of placing some funds with you for management purposeeither in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertakenafter due delibrations and under terms to be agreed upon. I will prefersthat this investment be made in your country if and when we have arrivedat a compromise.I sincerely appologise for writing you via this means even without priorestablished acquaintance. But I do beleive that as we get along you willcome to understand the reason for my writing through this means.I thank you for taking time to read my letter and hope that you willrespond soon with any inquiries that may help you decide on your next lineof action.RegardsJM.My Secured Email Address:joseph_m333@latinmail.com",1

"Atten:Nadkov. Dear Sir/Madam You may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don't know me in person but please take this mail into consideration. I am Mr. Nicholas Kular the son of late Mr. JOHNSON KULAR who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. Kindly work with me to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death he had earlier taken to South Africa the sum of US$ 26.5 Million (Twenty -Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which he deposited with a Security Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as VALUABLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was for purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely More than thirty-eight (38) people have so far been killed. Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe'splan. Subsequently South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land act it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history. More so the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance we are offering you 20% of the total sum 75% for me and my family while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses we may be incured during the course of this transaction. We wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally all i want from you is assurance that you will not betray my trust. If this appeal is acceptable to you please confirm your interest via the above telephone number or better still email. Best Regards. Mr.Nicholas Kular (For the Family). ",1

SidAlterNet / By Drew Westen24 COMMENTSWhat Created the Populist Explosion and HowDemocrats Can Avoid the Shrapnel inNovemberTo say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The only question at this point is how to mitigate thedamage when the bomb detonates in November.September 1 2010LIKE THIS ARTICLE ?Join our mailing list:Sign up to stay up to date on the latest headlines via email.ftagiou-b ialEffilgandwa ol¬ßto PolilitNTo say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatilemixture of fear and fury and when you mix those together you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how tomitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and whatthe House actually did do) namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keepAmericans employed. The "Obama Doctrine" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability tocontribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work and that if the private sector can't meet thedemand for jobs we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix new energy sources to develop and manufacture andschools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century globaleconomy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues from immigration totaxes and deficits I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began "We don't have ashortage of work ethic in this country we have a shortage of work." That message resonates across the politicalspectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughestdeficit-cutting language the other side can muster.But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine which Larry Summers enunciated on ThisWeek several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually comedown -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measureswhose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your childrenare hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people whodid are once again making out like bandits.Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shootingthemselves in the foot all over the country running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see MiddleAmerica from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if theyunderstand the public mood and speak to it.What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.On the right it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment atwhat could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in thevast political center populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs their homes and theirchildren's future.How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two ActsSo how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth andReconciliation without the Truth Part‚Ä¢ A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.By October 2008 upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happeningto their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.‚Ä¢ A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailoutwith no accountability. Unlike Republicans who would say "no" in a situation like this and let a Great Recessionturn into a Great Depression Democrats do the right thing but they don't make it clear from the start that theseare Bush Bailouts and remind Americans over and over that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcyof Republican ideology.‚Ä¢ A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations as he uniquely can. Americans arefrightened but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to "government is the problem not thesolution" and a path back to economic recovery and security.‚Ä¢ The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.‚Ä¢ The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position thatwe should "look forward not backward" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. Asconservative attacks on him and Democrats increase he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress orPresident Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in fiveeither behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers whogambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and torepeat it again and again? Because otherwise if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn'tsubside within a year and half voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in hisfirst year in office and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him along with former President Clintonto co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories but ifforced to he would cite unnamed "naysayers" "Washington politics as usual" or "Congress" which wascounterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in thismessaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:‚Ä¢ The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essentialwhen the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell even in a sound bite. But one of the besteducators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once with prodding butnever repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attackedhim for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into officebecause of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrificeexcept our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids who will be paying off this war for generations).A year later with Democrats on the ropes the president started to tell that story. It was the right move butappeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.‚Ä¢ The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and hisparty were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid brandingby conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.‚Ä¢ The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention tostimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing whatthey learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting theRepublicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert andwarning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might beneeded to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could startreturning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House thepresident chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent ofvoters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest pointfor the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.‚Ä¢ The economy continues its free-fall shedding 700000 jobs a month. Meanwhile Democrats don't take the kind ofdramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate but they remain hopeful thatthis new president will turn things around and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new "stimulus" act will docauterize the wound. Meanwhile the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat andno one is effectively answering the charges creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was neveradequately crafted or sold.‚Ä¢ The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in thefuture by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in theexcesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the newpresident and Congress. (Heading into November this is in fact the most popular piece of legislation theDemocrats have passed but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there and by then neither the presidentnor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead the same banks thatreceived bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts butdon't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injurythe banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent including on people's existing creditcard debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.‚Ä¢ Despite talk of accountability no one is fired (except one auto executive) virtually no one is prosecuted or eveninvestigated as far as anyone knows and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan‚Ä¢ The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at alland the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at thesame time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows itas evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz who warns that this will be an uphill climb foropponents of reform who would do well to accept some major elements of it.‚Ä¢ But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devisingany new ones of its own the administration decides to try to "sell" health care without a narrative. (I wrote aboutthis in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses tostate where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year such as whether weshould have a "public option" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imaginethe support it might have received if it had been called instead "the one health care plan the health insurancecompanies don't get to control"). Instead the White House uses phrases such as "bending the cost curve" whileconservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as "government takeover" "a bureaucrat betweenyou and your doctor" and "death panels."‚Ä¢ Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story which wouldexplain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid the White House once again offers a story withoutprotagonists or antagonists and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.‚Ä¢ Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare forseniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut SocialSecurity despite its popularity the public then watches what George Will describes as the "serial bribery" ofRepublican and Democratic Senators alike as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.‚Ä¢ At the 11th hour as a compromise plan is finally going to pass the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-likealternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire despite 60 percent ofeven swing voters wanting it included in the bill.‚Ä¢ Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and thatgovernment can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that thebetter plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are "Cadillacs" that are going to betaxed out of existence) the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anythingright and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the recordsupporting government or spending.‚Ä¢ "Government" hits an all-time low in the polls matching the popularity of big corporations CEOs and bailouts.‚Ä¢ Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum and the president's job approvalwith swing voters drops into the high thirties.‚Ä¢ Following the conventional wisdom Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch and conclude thatwhen in trouble tack right. On health care the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to "reassure"the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance but most of us didn't find thatreassuring) that domestic partners won't be covered and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issuesneeded to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them and well- messaged progressivepositions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)‚Ä¢ The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterlyconfused about where the president and by extension his party stands on the central issues of the day. Thepresident talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath using the metaphor of familiestightening their belt in tough times which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and "clean coal" (which doesn't exist by the way) in aspeech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward forpassing "No Latino Left Behind" while publicly objecting to the legislation.‚Ä¢ The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equalparts you win the center. In fact no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak opportunistic andincoherent to the average swing voter which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the centerdesperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why bothFDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base who feel demoralized andbetrayed (if they're part of the "professional left") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't followpolitics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore even if they don't really know why).‚Ä¢ Capping it all off the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the "drill here drill now" "allof the above" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfectopportunity to go on the offensive contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense protection of our safetythe land we leave our children and key American industries and jobs and sticking up for ordinary Americansagainst big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between whathappened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead the administration finds itselfon the defensive increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP allowing BP to call the shots and controlinformation for weeks defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics and issuing press releases that appearindistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.Where Do We Go from Here?So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely tovote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; anda vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren'tgoing well.In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democratsmight lose a few seats lost in an off-year election but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the Americanpublic knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history and theAmerican people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in bothhouses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change wasnecessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to thenew administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.Re-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's) and it's not one that supports aprogressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads thepublic to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes don't throwanother one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later the WhiteHouse hasn't consistently done any of these things although the President is now intermittently doing some of them andwhen he does he does them well.The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in thegame. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs including how to talkabout deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel particularly now -- there is little question that ifDemocrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative values-drivenand speak to people's worries and 'anger many stand a good chance of surviving November particularly when theiropponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals andfiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplateconservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And onissue after issue no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americansand small business owners against special interests big business and their lobbyists.But actions speak louder than words and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill weshould have seen a year and a half ago but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out ofwork by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popularaid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers firefighters and policeall over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out ofthe bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked againstthem and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses which create 75 percent of the new jobs in thiscountry and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoidpaying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to areasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass thefirst badly need "fix" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say thiswas just the first step namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent whilecutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were soessential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate toprevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's nottoo late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections so that thevoice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.On every one of these issues a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats needto play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill including those they expect the other side to blockknowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrativefrom what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- "the Republicans won't let us do it" -- to anarrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice betweentwo well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what andwho led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. Thatnarrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike rather than making each legislative issue aseemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some keyelements: that if the economy is tumbling it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Streetis gambling with our financial security our homes and our jobs true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquentaboUt the free market they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to workthen we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads bridges and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us fromcompeting with China's wind and solar energy programs then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctionalinvestments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean safefuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.Drew Westen Ph.D. is Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Emory University founder of Westen Strategies andauthor of The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.",0

"Dear BelovethI am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiahformer Finance Minister of Brunei the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the GulfIsland.I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family historywhich has already been disseminated by the international media during thecontroversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brotherthe sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.As you may know from the international media the sultan had accused myfather of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billiondollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made myfather company Amedeo Development Company and government owned BruneiInvestment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office.However my father was kept under house arrest his bank accounts andprivate properties including a crude oil export refinery were laterconfiscated by the sultanate.Furthermore during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate myimmediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution fromthe sultan and his security operatives but before I could do that I wasplaced under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phonebut I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you thismail.Before my In-castration I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under specialarrangement into the custody of different Private security and Trusteecompanys for safe keeping abroad.",1

"sbwhoeopSaturday March 20 2010 5:54 PMH: fyi. sidH: Uri Avnery the Israeli analyst and activist is privately circulating this analysis today. One consequence: Petraeuscannot run as a Republican. At least Putin didn't bring his big dogs in with him like he did with Merkel. Cheers SidUri Avnery20.3.10The Doomsday WeaponIT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don't learn from history are condemnedto repeat their mistakes.Some 1942 years ago the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against theRoman Empire. In retrospect this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small andinsignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against therival power ‚Äî the Parthian Empire (Persia) ‚Äî and put down a major rebellion in Britain. Whatchances could the Jewish revolt have?God knows what was going on in the mind of the "Zealots". They eliminated the moderateleaders who warned against provoking the empire and gained sway over the Jewishpopulation of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Romeand believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor Nero. Perhapsthey had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.We know how it ended: after three years the rebels were crushed Jerusalem fell and thetemple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way did not provokethe great powers endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They acceptedcompromises and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. Theycleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the wholeworld.But since the beginning of the occupation their mind has become clouded. The cult ofMasada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in publicdiscourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots.The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against thenew Rome.WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing intosomething far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.Lately the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obamawith thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his termhave dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. He gave up his demand for areal settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on he remarked that it was raining.Yet now ostensibly quite suddenly the measure is full. Obama his Vice President and hissenior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary ofState Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activityEast Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflictincluding East Jerusalem and more.The surprise was complete. Obama it seems has crossed the Rubicon much as the Egyptianarmy had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all thereserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations inthe US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered itssoldiers the Senators and Congressmen to storm the White House.It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obamawould be defeated.And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star generalson of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazisstood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a "distinguished cadet" in ArmyCommand and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander he reapedplaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served asan assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy.He made his mark in Iraq when he commanded the forces in Mosul the most problematicalcity in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must winover the hearts of the civilian population acquire local allies and spend more money thanammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was considered so outstandingthat his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soonbecame the chief of the Central Command of the US army which covers the whole Middle East except Israel and Palestine (which "belong" to the American command in Europe).When such a person raises his voice the American people listen. As a respected militarythinker he has no rivals.THIS WEEK Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in hisAOR (Area Of Responsibility) ‚Äî which includes among others Afghanistan Pakistan IranIraq and Yemen ‚Äî he turned to what he called the "root causes of instability" in the region. Thelist was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: "The enduring hostilities betweenIsrael and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance ourinterests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment due to a perception ofU.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength anddepth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens thelegitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile al-Qaeda and other militantgroups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in theArab world through its clients Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas."Not content with that Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefsof StaffIn other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties but asupreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sidedsupport for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution.The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past.(Immediately after the 9/11 attacks I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US wouldchange its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official documentwritten by the responsible American commander.The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Itsspokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach that he doesn'tunderstand political matters that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people inJerusalem break out into cold sweat.AS IS well known the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits‚Äî almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightestdeviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide.But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles' heel the immensemight of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that when touched can neutralize itspower.It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitiveintelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero a Jew who did hisduty to his people. But for the US intelligence community he is a traitor who endangered thelives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty it induced the court toimpose a life sentence. Since then all American presidents have refused the requests ofsuccessive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront hisintelligence chiefs in this matter.But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of SherlockHolmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewishcommunity fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard.Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything ‚Äî just anything ‚Äî for thegovernment of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt thesecurity of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted the Jews like all Americanssnap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above theirheads. For them this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israelahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly themantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. Thepolicy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraqand Afghanistan.FOR NOW this is being said only as a side remark in a military document that has not beenwidely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews havestarted to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake.This week Netanyahu's brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared thatObama is an "anti-Semite". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obamais really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies who argue in speech and inwriting that "Hussein" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the comingcongressional elections and in the next presidential ones.(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far fromconvinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama's treatment of Israel isfair. Indeed Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.)If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation that Israelputs the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequencesfor Israel.For the time being this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship inorder to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the‚Ä¢present crisis is somehow damped down it will inevitably flare up again and again as long asthe present coalition in Israel stays in power.When the movie "Hurt Locker" won its awards the entire American public was united in itsconcern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convincedthat Israel is sticking a knife in their back it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just forhim.",0

"Dear friend I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am William Mabaye the first and only surviving son of late Tutu Mabaye one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa to deposit the sum of US$25 million (Tweenty Five Million United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies as family valuables when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.I have decided to seek foreign assistance as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.There are two options firstly you can choose to accept 25% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone & fax numbers. I await your reply through the above email while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.Yours trulyWilliam Mabaye",1

Victor Aloma of the Democratic Republic of Congo I am one of close aids to the formal president of Congo Democratic LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory may his soul rest in peace.For the military of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebles in my country I was instructed by him (late president Kabila) to go to the Europe to purchase ARMSAND AMMUNIATION worth us$15.5(fifteen million Five Hundred Thousand us Dollars) to fight the reble groups. But when it became ap! parent that presidentKabila has been killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aids. I immediately decided to divert the fund ( US$15.5) into a private security company for safekeeping. The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile after the death of president Kabila.I need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partnerational who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.Though we have not seen nor met each other but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.Thus if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands you can contact me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what your percentage will be for assisting me.Please note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.Kindest RegardsCOL. Victor Aloma",1

"BARRISTER DAVID.W NELSONEquity ChambersLagos Nigeria. Attention: Greetings to you.

On April 12 2000 my client a ForeignOilConsultant/Contractor with the NigerianNational Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Mr. James Nartaev made a numberedtime (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$12000000.00(Twelve Million United States Dollars). Upon maturity of his deposit the chambers got a routine notification fromthe Finance House which was sent to his forwarding address. After a monthwe got a reminder from the Finance House and I had to verify his whereaboutfrom his contract employers the NNPC. Unfortunately I was informed by the NNPC that my client died from an automobileaccident about a month to the first letter froim the Finance House. As hislegal representative I know that my client died without making a WILLandall my attempts to trace his next of kin has been fruitless. Furthermore as his attorney I am aware that he did not declare any nextof kin or relations in all his official documents including his DepositoryForm with the Finance House.According to Nigerian Law at the expirationof 3 (three) years the money will revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives I seek yourconsent to present you as the next of kin of my late client so that theproceeds of this account valued at 12 million dollars (minus incurred interest)canbe paid to you. I will expect you to use your human discretion in sharingthe funds when it's been transferred into your custody. I will put together all necessary legal documents that can be used to backup any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enableus see this deal through particularly your words of honor not to sit onthe funds when it's in your control. Please!

"Dearest in the Lord Greetings to you and your family I am Mrs ELIZABETH LAMINE from liberia. I am married to Mr. Mike LAMINE who worked with liberia embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2004.He is also a well known fruits import and Export business man in Ivory Coast. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.6Million US dollars with a bank in Ivory Coast Presently this money is still in the custody of the bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or better to an individual personality that have a humanity understanding and trustworthy that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or an individual personality that is trustworthy to use this money for orphanages widows propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed is the hand that giveth". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace". I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development as I am convinced that With God by my said all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Ivory Coast I will also send a copy of my passport to you and my photo and also issue you an authority letter that will empower you to be the beneficiary of the money. I want you and your church to always pray for me because the Lord is my shepherd and he shall see us through My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy Christian so I have no fear at all for I am convinced that God is with me and he shall be with you if you make yourself available to take up this spiritual project of God. I believe that whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth thus I took this decision. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Contact me on this email via elizabeth_lamine2004@yahoo.co.uk always and please be informed that any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply. Remain blessed in the Lord. Yours in Christ MRS LIZABETH LAMINE ",1

"Good day You may be surprise to receive this letter from mesince you don't know me personally. I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bonganiwho was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. precisely More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistancewe are offering you 30% of the total sum60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finallyall we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country. If this proposal is acceptable by you please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. Best Regards. Jonathan Bongani(For the Family).",1

"MRS. SUSAN SHABANGUDeputy Minister of Minerals and EnergySouth Africa.Website:www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htmDear SirAfter due deliberation with my children I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$15.5M ( Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) First let me start by introducing myself I am MRS SUSAN SHABANGU a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy since 1st April 1996 to date under the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. You can view my profile at my website www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htmAfter the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. After his death I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which mounted to the sum of US$15.5M with SYNTHEX TRUST SECURITY AND PRIVATE COMPANY.This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1998 to date. If they discover this money in his bank account they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in government. I want your assistance in clearing this money from SYNTHEX TRUST SECURITY AND PRIVATE COMPANY.As soon as the fund is cleared you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country. I will see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your account I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.For your assistance I am offering you 4 Million (Four million United States Dollars Only) However you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund. If you agree to my terms kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South African Government I would not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to me.All correspondence must be by email to my private email. If you want to speak with my Attorney that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest with you.All correspondence must be made either to my Attorney Barrister James Ndlovu of kuramo lodge chambers on <jnchambers@justice.com> or send me an email to my private email box on mrs_susan00@yahoo.com or <mrs_susan2@123.com>.

"Dear Sir. May I seek your indulgence to introduce my humble self. I am Kokor Mobutu the son of the late Zaire Republic President Mobutu Sese Seko. Before the death of my father he kept in my custody the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales of diamonds he made when he was still on the throne. My father lodged this money in a security company outside our country for security reasons and because of the political instability in my country. My Father introduced me to the security company shortly before his death. He however deposited this money without any name rather with coded numbers which is in my possession. With my father dead my life was at great risk I therefore had to leave my country under cover to Spain. Now I have decided to invest this money in a suitable and conducive environment. At this point I now seek your assistance to transfer this money to your bank account for proper use. 20% of the total money will be yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure we might incur in the process while the balance will be for me. On the receipt of your positive response to assist me on this project all information related to the project will be made available to you on request. This business is 100% risk free as long as the confidentiality the business needs is observed. For this business to take off your bank particulars where this fund will be paid into is required.

"(1) No one has operated this account since 2000;(2) He died without a heir; hence the money has been floating. (3) No other person knows about this account and there was no known beneficiary. And if we do not remit this money urgently it would be confiscated and forfeited for nothing. I have secretly discussed this matter with account officer and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate and does not originate from drug money laundering terrorism or any other illegal act. On your interest let me hear from you.On your interest let me have your private/direct contact numbers including fax and a copy of your International Passport or driver's license for easy communication identification and trust. I must be reached only on my private contact details for confidential reasons. Regards",1

I got your contact addressthrough internet net work search when searching for a good and reliableperson that will assist me in this transaction.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars (twenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in anaccount thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY2000 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE along with his entire family.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his nextof kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release itunless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceasedas indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt thatall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequentdisbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money togo into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remainedunclamed after seven year the money will be transfered into the Banktreasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand asnext of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner inrespect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you asarranged you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin ofthe deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number yourprivate telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication andlocation where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text ofthe application.

" I am the personal account officer to the great late INDUSTRIALIST who had an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa. Forgive my contact because this letter comes to you as a surprise as you don't know of it's coming before. My contact is for you to please assist to transfer US$125000.000.00 ( One hundred & twenty- five million United States dollars only) in tranches from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to any oversea's account(s). The account was opened in 1998 and he died in 2003 without a written or oral WILL and since 2003 nobody had operated the account. The account is dormant and the funds floating. If I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited to the bank. Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction because of my official position and nature of the deal. The business can be concluded in 10 (ten) banking days .I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude. The account holder was a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the accountant of the company. My investigation through the National immigration department proved to me as well that he was single as at the time of his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The credit balance in this account is USD$125 Million ( One Hundred & Twenty five Million United States Dollars only). Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information on this account which I will disclose to you if you are interested to do this business with me.There is no risk in this business if you follow my instructions. Given my position and my personal rapport with the manager of the bank the funds can be transferred to any account(s) you nominate .I need an assurance from you that this money will be intact pending my arrival to your bank for disbursements. State the A/C Details.A/c No:............Bank Name:........A/c Holder:........Beneficiary Name:... We will start with the first swift wire-transfer of US$25 million( Twenty -five million United States only) Upon successful transfer of the first tranch without any disappointment from your side you shall apply for the outstanding sum of US $100 Million to the same or other account(s). Armed with correct information as a foreigner and appropriate documentations as we shall arrange I will use my position to secure a prompt conclusion to the transaction. Your duty is to send me the banking coordinates for the transfer while maintaining the required confidentiality . At the conclusion of the transfer you will receive 35% 5% will be for any expenses both parties incurred in the process of this business and 60% of the funds will be for me. Upon your strong assurance of your full cooperations and receipt of your account details then I will start the process of the funds transfer to your account without further delay.

"Good Day my dear friend I wish to request for your assistance in a financial Transaction I decided to contact you based on a certain issue that is of paramount importance to me.But most importantly I want you to show your credibility promise that you will be honest and trustworthy to me during my relationship with you I am until recently a first year medical student at the University of GhanaWest Africa. on the 27th of November 2002 in my home town YENDI CAPITAL DAGBON NORTHERN REGION OF GHANA some unknown mub attacked and brutal murdering in my family home with the killing of both uncles and aunts including my sister and brothers most expecially my father who was the key target king or"lion" of DagbonYa-Naa YAKUBU ANDANI II .WELL YOU CAN FIND OUT BY YOURSELF THROUGH(www.bbcafrica.com) search event on the(regicide in dagbon region of GHANA) . Fortunately for me I was in school when the attack took place. I equally lost my only sister to the"ABUDU MUBS".When I got home for the remains of my parentsI discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited $17.7M United States Dollars (Seventeen Million Seven hundred thousand USdollars) in a private security firm in JOHANNESBURG. This money according to the document was meant for the building of an ultra modern hospital for me by my late father when I complete my studies.Upon the discovery of this document  I left GHANA in trace of the private security firm and the safer of my life to make claims for the mentioned money as the only surviving next of kin to my father. But deliberately I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money and decided to invest it with you in your country. I have succeeded in making the people at the security company to believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to it are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it out to your country or through your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that I will be ready to be in need of it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world. Most importantly I seriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality with the whole transaction.Thanks and may Allah bless and guide you. more details awaits your urgent response.

" Dear Sir It is my great pleasure to write you this letter onbehalf of my colleagues. Your information were givento me by a member of the South African ExportPromotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the BlackEconomic Empowerment Commission (Government)delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreigninvestors. I have decided to seek a confidentialco-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunderfor the benefit of all parties and hope you will keepit confidential because of the nature of thisbusiness. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I workas the Director of Project Implementation withco-operation of two other top officials we have inour possession an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of thecontract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by aforeign contracting firm which we the officialsover-invoiced to the amount ofUS$41500000.00 (Forty One Million Five HundredThousand United States Dollars). Though the actualcontract cost has been paid to the originalcontractor leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believethat private investment in general and foreign directinvestment in particular are the real engines forsustainable economic development for which reason ithas continued to encouraged investment in the keygrowth-oriented sector of Mining with sinceredetermination to pay foreign contractors all debtsowed to them so as to continue to enjoy closerelationship and mutually beneficial co-operationwith foreign governments and non-governmentalfinancial agencies. As a result we included our billsfor approvals with the co-operation of some officialsat the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank ofSouth Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance tobe the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds since weare not allowed to operate foreign account. Thechanging of beneficiary's information/ details andother forms of documentation upon application forclaim to reflect the contract money and its approvalswill be secured on behalf of your company or yourself. I have the authority of my colleagues involved topropose that should you be willing to assist us inthis transaction your share as compensation will be20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70% andthe balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse allexpenditures taxes and miscellaneous expenses soincurred. It does not matter whether or not your company doescontract projects of the nature described here. Theassumption is that your company won the major contractand subcontracted it to other companies. More oftenthan not big trading companies and firms of unrelatedfields win major contracts and subcontract to morespecialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe provided you treatit with utmost confidentiality. Also yourspecialization is not a hindrance to the successfulexecution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. Ihave reposed my confidence in you and hope that youwill not disappoint us.

" PLEASE REPLY TO k_omidire@yahoo.comGood day and a happy and prosperous new year !I am Kolapo Omidire company secretary and managerinternal and external services of COMMERCIAL BANK OFAFRICA. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of mybank who perished with his entire family (His wife and only son) in a plane crash (Korean Air Line801) on August 6 1997.Since the demise of this customer of ours  the bankmanagement of COMMERCIAL BANK OF AFRICA has made valuableefforts to get in touch with any of the late customer'sNext-of-Kin or relative anywhere in the world but unfortunately all our efforts did not yield any positiveresults as no one has come to claim his funds to the tuneof Twenty one million five hundred thousand united statesdollars(USD21.5m) which has been with my bank all thesewhile.Recently the Federal Government of Nigeria directed thatall funds not claimed (which has exceeded the stipulatedbanking period of seven years for such money) should beconfiscated to the Federal Government Treasury Becausethe banking ethics here does not allow such money to staymore than seven years.This means that this money will berecalled to the federal Government treasury as unclaimedafter this period precisely within this first quater of this year.On this note the chairman of the board of directors of thebank recently called me and told me in confidence and trustto source for a reliable foreigner who would stand as ourforeign customer's next of kin. We (myselfand the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collectthis money the Nigerian government will confisticate it andsomeone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we havedecided to contact you hoping you will prove tobe a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to thedeceased customer to claim the total fund from his accountwith the bank so that the proceeds of his account can bepaid to you.Be assured that this transaction is risk free and we willdo all possible to give it the legal and legitimate backingit requirs so that both parties will be protected frombreach of the law both locally and internationally.Upon receipt of your response I shall furnish you with thenext step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim toyour account. The entire transaction should be completedwithin 10 official working days fromthe day the bank receives your initial application.When you receive this letter Kindly send me an e-mailsignifying Your acceptance or otherwise include yourprivate Telephone numbers for more explanationand confidential communication.Waiting to hear from you soonBest RegardsK.

"FROM; MRS GRACE BOLA IGEGreetings I am making this contact to you on the fact that we may be of assistance to each other in developing a long lasting cordial business relationship if you put your trust in God that this will work out forthe benefit of my own family and yours. I was moved by my personal inspiration to entrust on your sincerity to handle a business relationship that involves huge money on trust. I was constrained by the sudden death of my husband the former Minister of Power andsteel and currently before his death the Minister for Justice of my country whom was assassinated by an unknown men. I am Mrs. grace Bola Ige the second wife of the late Mr. Bola Ige who died on December 23rd 2001. With heart full of grief I regret to inform you of the inhumane and harsh conditions which my husband's first wife and the brother's have subjected my two daughters and me. Since my husband's deaththe relatives have been wicked to us because of the following reasons:1. I am not from the same tribe with them2. My refusal to learn and speak their tribal language and dress like other women from their tribe3. My refusal to accept their religion4. Because I have no male child5. Because I was specially loved and favored I am absolutely tired of all these threats from my husband relatives since the death of my husband.I am no longer in their Family house. am now in my husband's guesthouse with my daughters I seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations.Few weeks before my husband's death he entrusted some security documents that cover a deposit he made to a security company to the tune of 25 million U.S dollars to my care for safe keeping in my apartment in Abuja. After his death I acted fast and required to gather information about the consignment. I was made to know that it was deposited as family treasure of a foreigner/associate to be delivered on request. This fund was deposited for safe keeping with a Private Security Company. Now I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can come down to clear the funds in his/her name as the sole beneficiary of the Consignment. This is so because of my status here as a widow of a political juggernaut. Now I solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping. This I cannot lodge into a bank account here in my name to avoid suspicion from the Government my husband's brother's and wife since they have Confiscated all that is left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they could lay hands on more including cash as they have left me and my children without any cash.If you can accept this I urge you to contact us immediately for us to brief you on arrangement on how we can possibly handle this.This is why I honestly contacted you because investing this money abroad should be the best for my dauthers and me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of dealing with the investment proceeding with you.I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save US from a hopeless future. And if you agree I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 30% of the principal sum. While the remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and different sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends yielding. Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email.And keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my Family.I regret to inform you of the inhumane and harsh conditions which my husband's first wife Justice Mrs. Atinuke Ige and the brother's have subjected me and my two daughters. Since my husband death the relatives have been wicked to us in my husband family.I hope to hear from you soon.MRS GRACE BOLA IGE",1
"FROM THE DESK OF MrKAREM AHMED.BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGERBANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOUBURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA.PHONE CONTACT 00226.78.89.77.34DEAR FRIENDI know you may be surprise to recieve this e-mail ; I got your contact address from the internet while I was searching for my friend that has similar name with you.I am the manager of bill and exchange BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) at foreign remittance department.There is a business I would want you to champion for me in my department I discovered an abandoned sum of ($31.500.000 U.S) thirty one million five hundred thousands US dollars)In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 25TH JULY 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengerÔøΩs aboard. The name of the deceased man was(MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany)N.B. In other for you to believe me honestly visit the web site to enable you know whether we can work together below is the website. http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmYou have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I was arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank management for the annual audit of the year.Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I donÔøΩt want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after some years the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant (A Banker) we are not allowed to operate any foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I donÔøΩt want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name your bank account number your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days with your full support.This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any precaution there after.Upon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letterreply to thi box. at;Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfullyMrKAREM AHMEDBill and exchange managerBANK OF AFRICA_________________________________________________________________Personnalisez votre Messenger avec Live.com http://www.windowslive.fr/livecom/",1

"From:Mr. Patrick K W. Chan.Good Day I am Mr. Patrick K. W. Chan. Executive Director and Chief FinancialOfficer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Col. Hosam Hassan who was withthe Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed depositfor 18 calendar months with a value of Thirty Million United StateDollars($30000000.00) only in my branch.Upon maturity several noticeswas sent to him even during the war which began in 2003. Again afterthe war another notification was sent and still no response came fromhim.We later find out that Col. Hosam Hassan along with his wife and onlydaughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit theirhome.After further investigation it was also discovered that our clientCol.Hosam Hassan did not declare any next of kin in his official papersincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided inme the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of hisdeposit in my bank. So Thirty Million United StateDollars($30000000.00)is still lying in my bank and no one will evercome forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the la=wsofmy country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to theownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim thefunds. Against this backdropmy suggestion to you is that I will likeyou as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Col.Hosam Hassan sothatyou will be able to receive his funds.MODALITIES:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that weshall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare thenecessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Col.Hosam Hassanall that is required from you at this stage is for you toprovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can comm=encehis job.After you have been made the next of kin the attorney will alsofill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and o=fprobate in yourfavour for the move of the funds to an account that willbe provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter as weare going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all t=henecessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion inall matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account weshall then share in the ratio of 60% for me 40% for you.Should you beinterested please send me your1Full names2Private phone number3Current residential address.And I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below;(pkwchan_hk@yahoo.com.hk)and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of thisoperation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind RegardsMr. Patrick K.

An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death of my husband my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the government and the press about my husband. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and all assests siezed. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control. The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all our accounts both local and international but my only hope now is the available US$100Million cash which I carefully packaged and deposited with a security finance company in Holland.My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the funds will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time when I will be free from my present predicament.Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication.

It is my utmost desire to execute the Will of our late client. You are required to contact me immediately to start the process of transferring this money to any of your designated official account. I urge you to contact me immediately for further details bearing in mind that the Bank has given us a date limit. ",1
"Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we have never met before but I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed insistent headlines in the CNN BBC news bulletins My name is Mr. Adam Winpoe from Liberia a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:http://www.usatoday.comews/world/2003-07-15-Liberia_x.htmhttp://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.aspBefore he was killed my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that 'nobody not even himself can have access to the consignment in the company and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund.My decision to contact you is therefore informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit which is worth $21.5Million(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army.You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. Kindly confirm in your reply if you can come over to enable us conclude this transaction. Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you.This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality.Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently.Thank you.SincerelyMr. Adam WinpoeFor the Family.___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at - http://www.ca-vn.net",1

"" ACCOUNT. My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However this correspondence is unofficial and private and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER a program leader.Until his deathThe Late Prime Minister Mr. Rafik Hariri has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1 1944 - February 14 2005) married to Nazek Audi Hariri was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 20 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital for more information please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/) I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. Best Regards Mr.Jason Leicester . ---------------------------------Want to be your own boss?

" bwean farmers a 45-day quit notice to leave their lands to the government. </DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV>My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland a neighbouring country where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>With a capital base of US$25.5Million there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South ! Africa. We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa. This money is presently deposited confidentially with A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out 25% of the gross sum as due commission for your expected honest assistance in executing the successful transfer of this money out of South Africa for our family investments.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Please email us immediately if you are interested so we can discuss further while we hold this correspondence in the strictest confidence. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Thanks and God bless you. <BR>Yours truly <BR>Evan Smith</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><BR><BR>REJOYCE<p><font face=arial size=-1><a href="http://in.rd.yahoo.com/specials/mailtg/*http://yahoo.shaadi.com/india-matrimony/" target="_blank"><b>Yahoo!

" My name is john paul a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility =of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes which have remained dormant since World War II.It may interest you to know that in July of 1997 the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54000 in December 1999.The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts including interest-bearing savings accounts securities accounts safe deposit boxes custody accounts and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 35000000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).Being a top executive at ICEP I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be banked in the Cayman Island being a tax free safe haven for funds and we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.Due to the sensitive nature of my job I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you.Kindly provide me with your full name address and telephone/fax. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a secure numbered account in your name in the Cayman Island of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:www.swissbankclaims.comhttp://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9902/09/germany.holocaust/www.avotaynu.comwww.icheic.orgwww.livingheirs.comwww.wiesenthal.comThe Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.I find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.Due to security reasons reply to my via email only. You may reply to me securely on the following emailgtmail_john@email.czThank you for your prompt response.john paul--053a6937-e2bb-11d8-b720-003018010c2d--",1
