Excellent service/Quick/Honest
Called Brad at 5:30 and had a tech at my house at 8:00
Diagnosed the problem in 15 min. 
Needed the fan motor and capacitor replaced.
Luke called the manufacture and found out 
The parts were under warranty ($750.00 savings)
Luke and Antonio were very professionL excellent
Prices. Would highly recommend
