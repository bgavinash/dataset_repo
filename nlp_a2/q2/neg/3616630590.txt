Cons
Infested with scorpions
police are always here, have seen 3 stand off situations
If you need a one stop shop for drugs move here plenty of sellers
Pretty sure the leasing lady is on meth or crack too
It takes forever for maintenance to get to your order
car has been broken into numerous times
lots of stray cats
raise your rent every time up for renewal
tenants don't watch their kids they are out until all hours of the night
Very disrespectful teenagers and under age drinking
lots of dog poo
very high speed bumps that scrape the bottom of your car
nothing in the gym works
expensive laundry
single compartment sink
minimal parking that isn't covered
