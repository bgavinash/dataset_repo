Went in the other day. Never been there before.
The atmosphere was very nice. I loved that 
Part of the business. I didn't feel they had enough
Options to be considered a bakery. I asked go the strawberry 
Shortcake. I was very surprised the cake was 
$19.00+. I was shocked at the price for such
A small cake, but I bought it and was hoping it would
Be worth it. The cake was very dry but the strawberry
Glaze was good. I was disappointed to say the least.
