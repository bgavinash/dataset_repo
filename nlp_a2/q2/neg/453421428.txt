Just overpriced bar food (and apparently Italian). I was running out of time for lunch, so I figured what the hell. The menu had standard bar fare and some pasta items. It is very pricey for a lunch menu with most items ranging around $15. The restaurant was pretty busy and I imagine this is because of its prime location. I had a cheese burger ($9.95). It was nothing special but it came with mayo. What is this, Canada?
