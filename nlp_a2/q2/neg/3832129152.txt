MSG bomb all over.

Most chinese ppl would find this restaurant offensive.  I only ate here b/c I saw Mr Wynn himself eating lunch here.  I wouldn't come back.  They also have a terrible service issue.   More specifically, the servers standing there.  Not servicing the customers.  No need to bring your own soy sauce...food's salty enough.
