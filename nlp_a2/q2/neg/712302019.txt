Terrible food, terrible service. They actually rounded up all our items on our bill and added a service charge they couldn't tell us about when the other couple we dined with inquired about it. Their exact words were "service charge is service charge". 

Our order:
Borscht soup $4.95
Cabbage rolls $14.95
Beef trip soup $4.50
Meat pierogis $8.00

Our bill:
Borscht soup $5
Cabbage rolls $15
Beef trip soup $5
Meat pierogis $8.00
Total : $32+ 13% tax + service charge = $40

My bf paid the bill before we even looked it over so they received $46.

Eat at your own risk, food is extremely bland and covered with butter (the tripe soup had a huge buttery film at the top and the pierogis were swimming in butter) and they'll put bogus charges on your final bill.
