WoW!!!!  Wish I could give more than 5 stars!!  Went in today looking for white sage to do a smudge on my new house!  Upon stepping in the door amazing energy and aroma hit me!!!  Every question I had for Brittney was not only answered but extra suggestions were given!!  I love the fact that when I left I knew more than going in!  Not only did I buy things for myself but also for my dog who has terrible anxiety!  Cannot thank you enough for all the time you spent with me today!!  Will for sure be a regular in the future!!! (HUGS!!!)
