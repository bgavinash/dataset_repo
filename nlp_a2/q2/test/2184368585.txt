My grandmother and I just came in for a late lunch. We got seated and 10 min went by without anyone coming to us. Then a waitress named Alicin asked "has anyone come to help you?" We said no. So she took our drink orders and got us chips and salsa. She told us that she was actually serving the other side of the restaurant but she wanted us to be served. She treated us like royalty until we left that door. She even gave us free dessert! We left very satisfied. Hope for her to be our waitress every time we go.
