I stumbled across this gym after doing some work at a friends house. That's when I met the owner John Juadines. I expressed an interest in trying out crossfit after years of being bored at traditional gyms. He invited me and my girlfriend in to a Saturday class and we were amazed. We signed up immediately. We just finished our foundations classes today. The amount of detail he teaches in to the specific movements and lifts was incredible. And every lift and exercise has scalable levels of difficulty so everybody can achieve success at all levels of ability and work towards the more difficult exercises. Needless to say we loved this gym and are so excited to start the regular classes. One last note, the members of this gym are awesome. Everybody is really close and you get a true sense of family. There's no judgement, everybody is uplifting. I invite anyone who wants to take control of their life, health, and wellbeing to check this place out. I promise you will be impressed.
