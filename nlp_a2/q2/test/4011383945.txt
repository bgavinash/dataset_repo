We went to watch a baseball game at 4 PM on a friday. I thought "how could this place be THAT bad".. ha

Our waitress well sucked. My bf ordered a "ciroc breeze". she brings a glass of just plain cirOCK (she can't pronounce what she's serving). Then she procedes to be rude with us when we explain, no we wanted the cocktail called circoc breeze "well that's not what you said". HUH, first of all we were sober and I know we were right, and secondly isn't the customer always right?

Drinks are PRICEY even by vegas standards. Think small, ill crafted cocktails for $16-$18. We're talking tiny cups, crappy combinations, etc. I don't mind paying up for a tasty well made drink.. these were just slop in a cup for $16. UGH.

Atmosphere was "cool", but seriously in a sports bar does it make sense that you should only be able to watch 1-2 games at a time? We were seated in the "main part" which was comfy, but seriously we had a view of the main tv and one smaller side tv. Isn't the point of a sports bar to watch MULTIPLE games? On weekends in football season I can't imagine picking  a bar that would only let me watch one game. LAME. Also I was told minimums will be $75 pp during football season. WTF

Also, on friday they had all the staff carry around these stupid plastic bags filled with T-shirts to try to sell you on. So a club with platinum/gold floors selling $16 drinks needs to try to make extra money selling $20 t-shirts? Huh?

The extra star is for the chef who was super friendly and gave us a nice tour and put forth and effort to make sure the game we wanted was on. He was super shady when i asked about Jay Z selling the club,however. He claimed it's all just rumors.. sure...
