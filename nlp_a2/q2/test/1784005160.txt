OK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. We first visited with friends from the San Francisco area while showing them the area. We are new to Arizona (1 year) moved from the SF area and have visited Cave Creek several times before finding this GREAT lunch spot. Great sandwiches, attentive service and the bartender (owner) is wonderful. The outdoor area is quiet and far enough off the main road to make the time spent very enjoyable. AGAIN THIS IS THE REVIEW PROMISED MANY MONTHS AGO (our friends goofed). Keep up doing what you are doing and see ya next trip up your way. Bob/Vets
