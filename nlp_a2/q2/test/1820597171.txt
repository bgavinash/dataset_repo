What a ridiculous experience I had at this Starbucks. 
I ordered three drinks totaling around $10. I offered a $20 which was s little mangled but definitely in one piece. The cashier wanted me to give him another note and got all hissy when I refused. What kind of training does Starbucks provide to their staff?
