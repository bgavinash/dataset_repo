I have been bringing my pup to Camp Bow Wow Avondale for over 2 years now.  I have a very high energy dog that needs long periods of play time.  Sending her to camp helps tire her out, but also has helped her become great at socializing with other dogs and people too!  We are frequent visitors, and the wonderful staff are always so welcoming and helpful to this very crazy dog mom.  When it came time to adopting a new dog, I was even able to talk it out with a few of the staff to identify personality traits to look for based on my pups preferences in the play yard.  Bringing the new pup in for the first time, he was really nervous (even with his experienced sister by his side).  The amazing staff spent the day interacting and comforting him.  He now happily prances in with his sister as well!  Both of my pups love going to camp and playing with all of their doggy and human friends!!

While traveling, I have tried out different day cares (even another camp bow wow) and none have compared to Camp Bow Wow Avondale!
