I tried Fern today and it was absolutely wonderful.  We sat outside because the weather was beautiful but did take a peak inside and it appeared to be a great atmosphere.  Be sure to ask about the Fern wall, it is very interesting.  Whom I expect was the owner was very friendly and informative!  

Immediately upon entering the service was top notch.  Very friendly and educated staff (on the food that is).

I ate the OM Burger which was out of this world.  I have had many a "veggie burgers" but this one was definitely in a league of its own.  I highly suggest the goat cheese!  I had the quinoa as a side, and it was about as exciting as you can make quinoa but very good nonetheless.

This is definitely going to be a regular stop on the rotation!
