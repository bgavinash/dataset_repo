We absolutely loved working with Gristle Catering for our family event.  Many of our guests commented on the tenderness of the Charcoal Rotisserie Chicken. We also received many positive comments about their grilled salmon, macaroni and cheese and the best broccoli I've ever tasted. I was also in awe of how well all of the food was presented. It was truly a magnificent spread. I'm so glad that I found and hired Gristle and can't wait to hire them again for our next event.
