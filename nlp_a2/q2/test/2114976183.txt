I have been getting my nails done for over 10 years, so I know what they should look like and a proper job. This has been my most disappointing experience yesterday at Galaxy nails. I went in for a full set, first the lady kept trying to get me to keep my nails long when I told her I wanted them short. Then, I had to ask her to put more acrylic, because the way she did it they were paper thin. Once I left already frustrated by having to coach her through my nail appointment I noticed she didnt file them properly. They are so bumpy, and she did noy give them proper shaping from the cuticle down. My HUSBAND even said something  and men hardly pay attention ti those details. Her concern for quality was NON EXISTENT! I recently moved and was trying a shop close to me, but I now regret it and will never go back. It's not nice to charge $40 and not give a customer a good experience.
