I have gone to Angels a few times and my nails have always turned out good except for this last time!  I had a gel manicure and a polish change on my toes.  My toes were chipping in less than a week and some of my toes weren't even fully polished.  My nails started chipping at about a week!  Angels is reasonable priced but I would recommend paying the extra money and going somewhere else!
