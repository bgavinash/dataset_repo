A roofing company?  For gutters?  I don't think so.  The problem is that a roofing company does roofs.  If they did gutters, their name would - probably - be "Gutter Company".  Of course, the gutter companies don't actually call back.  So sometimes you don't have a lot of choice.

In this case, that was exactly the position I was in, and at least H&S came out.  That may give them a bit more credit than other companies.  Unfortunately they lose that credit because their installers are so, so bad.

I can't actually speak to their ability as roofers, but the guys who install gutters for H&S really don't seem to know what they are doing.

They take whatever pieces they may have on the truck and they try and make them fit.  It's a bit like watching a kindergarten class try to pound whatever shape they have through the little workbench.

So you get the rectangle that is supposed to go on one way all stretched out and jammed into place so that it goes on the other way.  It's really that bad.  Is it so hard to make sure that you have the correct pieces?

And instead of looking at what you are doing, they just throw the downspouts on whatever way they think is best - some are thin side up, some are wide side, even if they are just a few feet apart.  So appearance has nothing to do with the process.

All the while, the guys are bending and crimping metal with their bare hands and you end up with blood on the walls.  I'm not overly concerned about that, it just doesn't seem particularly professional is all.  As bad as the gutter situation is in Charlotte, I'm going elsewhere next time.
