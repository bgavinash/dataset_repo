I had several pleasant visits to the Walnut Grill in Bridgeville and am no doubt of fan, so I expected the same from the Robinson location. Friday night 7:00- we sat at the bar and there were a few empty bar stools it was a tad crowded.  There were two bartenders working - a man with a pony tail who was rocking out each order and another who didn't seem to want to be bothered?!  We grew tired of the challenge of trying to get another drink so decided to go else ware.
