Literally the worst Walgreens I've ever dealt with. Pharmacy staff is ever-changing and consistently lazy. I've seen some pretty ridiculous interactions between  the pharmacists/techs and some shady people due to the area so I can somewhat understand them being a bit jaded, but that doesn't excuse their performance especially when it comes to us normal people who just happen to live close by and want to use a Walgreens for our prescriptions. I am looking into switching to CVS today.
