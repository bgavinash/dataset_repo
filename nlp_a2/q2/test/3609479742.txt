We went in with a coupon for a buy one get one half off.  I  asked if I could use the cuopon for fried rice she said I could.  Then charged us full price.  I asked if this was half price and she assured me that it was.  I thought that $14 or $15 dollars for fried rice was pretty steep and the prices were not posted.  I found the menu online and it appears she did not give me the discount for the coupon and lied to me about it.  I guess they do not really want our business.  Have not gone back and do not plan to we can go to the Rice Garden right across the street in Bashas. . .
