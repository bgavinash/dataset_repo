Best diner in town. I've only been here for breakfast but I've gone to both locations, strip district and north hills. There's a waitress at the strip district that is really awesome. They use good quality ingredients. I'd recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit cup, any of the eggs Benedict (it's done perfectly) and they even have fried mush!
