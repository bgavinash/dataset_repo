UPDATED 2-23-16. The management was bought out, and this place, this beautiful place... they destroyed this place. kicked out all the "weekly" residents, put water all in the pool, and they stopped the soothing drips from the leaking faucets and clogged drains..... I even hear they have a working fire hydrant. W. T. F.  

This place used to be everything Vegas is about, yeah it had its issues, but at the end of the day you got good service, with a crapload bum nugget of a deal that you couldn't say no to... Like that questionably attractive brunette alone at the end of the bar at 3am... 

Aruba, you were my first weekly, and you will be sorely missed... dank wafts of billowing crack smoke gently caressing the moonlit sky.
