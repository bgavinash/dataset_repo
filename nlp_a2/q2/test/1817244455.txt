Totally delicious food with friendly service. Have been wanting to try this place for a while now.

Had no issues making a reservation for 7 peeps a couple of days before, the gentleman was super lovely and friendly who took my call. They also had no qualms about separating the bills.

Enjoyed a few cocktails with dinner, including an apple cider mimosa (so so good!), one of their drink features. We were entertaining family from the States so of course we had to order a couple of poutines as starters to share, which were very good.

I opted for the mac and cheese as my main and did not regret it. The noodles were perfectly cooked, drowning in creamy cheesy goodness and topped with crispy butter Ritz crackers. I'm drooling thinking about it tbh. Most of our table got either the chicken and waffles or half chicken, everyone was totally stuffed but loved their food.

Note, if you are on a diet - don't come here. They serve decadent and super yummy comfort food that sticks to your bones and warms your belly. Can't wait to return!
