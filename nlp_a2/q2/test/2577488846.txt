One time I just finished eating at Miega and as I was walking out of the restaurant, I heard someone playing guitar down the hall way. Due to my curiosity, I went there and found out this lovely studio. They were hosting a party night that weekend, and the director happened to be there when he saw me walking by. So he introduced me to their studio. It was a wild experience - the artists used very creative and interesting techniques making paintings/sculptures on wood and/or using different materials than just traditional canvas or paper. In the party room, someone was doing a talk show, and the next person played guitar. The audience just sat there, having a beer or two, eating some of the snacks provided. Yes the beer and snacks were all free. I felt bad just take their drinks (he said water and soda/juices were also available) and food, so I didn't stay, but I was absolutely fascinated by their passion for arts and community. You should definitely check it out!
