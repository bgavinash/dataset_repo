I miss planet dailies... I am not a fan of this place at all.  The family was hungry and I remembered PH had a great diner spot.  To my surprise this new spot stood in its place.  Can you cheery???!!  Photos of celebrities all over the place, no thanks but I was stuck, the wife and kids were hungry.  The meal comes out and follows the experience up to that point.  Terrible, Overpriced and bland.  I have no issue paying up for resort/hotel food but at least have it be good.  So disappointed and will never come back here.
