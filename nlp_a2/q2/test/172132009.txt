The quality of this place has steadily gone downhill over the past few years. I never expected the world, but for a $22 deluxe car wash, I'd expect a far more thorough cleaning.

The staff's attitudes border between "I don't care" and "you're interrupting my smoke break." The exterior wash, done in the automatic tunnel, was passable. A little spray down by hand, and then the machines take over.

Once the "detailers" take over, it seems to be a genuine crapshoot as to whether you'll actually get clean windows or what could best be described as an artistic swirljob that's immediately noticeable as you pull onto Route 30, and the blazing sun refects off your windshield. It was also quite easy to notice the dashboard wasn't cleaned either.

The detailer also remarked to a coworker about how "people need to get these f---ing rubber mats out of their f---ing cars because it's not f---ing winter anymore." (He was referring to my car, which has permanent rubber mats, not carpeting.)

In all, I don't plan to return -- I can do a better job (and curse at myself) on my own.
