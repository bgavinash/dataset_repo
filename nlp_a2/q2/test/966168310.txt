Not only did Justin (one of the digital designers) design the perfect shirt for me, he went above and beyond to find the exact phrase that I wanted even though he had to ask 4-5 other staff members and even place a phone call to find it. He was responsive when I gave input in the design, he listened well to my needs, and he gave on-point recommendations when he noticed something could be improved. On top of all of that, my order was printed and ready to go within a few hours, which was way ahead of my deadline. The price was a little high and I had to wait 20 minutes to see an artist, but for the quality of service and final product it was worth the time and money spent.
