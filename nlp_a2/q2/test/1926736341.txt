I've tried this place 3 times now, it's always different people and none of them seem to know what they are doing. This time I went in at 4:30, I ordered a bucket of wings, 4 orders of cheese sticks, 3 orders of potato skins and 1 dozen boneless wings. At 5:20 someone came and said my order was almost ready then within 5 minutes came and told me they were out of potato skins and boneless wings. I was told they would refund my money for those things and give me 20% off the rest. The problem is I needed all that food to feed my family. Part of the order wasn't going to work. I had heard them talking in the back earlier about being out of potato skins but I assumed they meant after my order or they would have told me earlier. I also had to leave for work at 6:30 so had very little time to figure out what to get for dinner. I cancelled the order and asked if the refund would be immediately back in my account because I needed the money for dinner somewhere else and was told it would be. It wasn't. As I write this I still don't have the money back. I tried to call several times finally after the 5th try someone answered. I explained the situation he took my phone number and said he would call back. I have not heard from him. I like to support neighborhood business and I understand new businesses needing to work out some kinks but this was ridiculous. Poor management, poor customer service, poor communication and poor follow up. There are several other Long Wongs, I suggest picking a different one!
