Maybe I should come here at night, get a tee up on a top floor and be on a date but this just wasn't a great time for me. I don't like the fact you can't make a time reservation without money commitment. The hour plus wait to start playing just wasn't worth it. I did like their beer selection and their appetizers were decent (but nothing I would order again). We had the fried pickles, queso with guacamole chips, flatbreads (steak and buffalo) and ice cream cookie. The best app was the buffalo flatbread, the rest were anticlimactic. The service was good but I just felt bored with the golf concept. At the end of the day you are still golfing so if you don't love golfing (I actually do like it) this might not be a fun time for you. It reminded me of bowling where it's continual waiting and confusion on who's turn it is. Next time I think I will just sneak a 6 pack into the driving range and save myself the time and wait!
