It was nothing that impressed me out of all the great restaurants in Cleveland. Plus the service was pretty bad. The bar staff stood around bitching about other staff and took forever to get drinks (was not busy at all) anyway... Got the roasted bone marrow! Was so pumped about it. Some was good I guess. Very gelatinous..
