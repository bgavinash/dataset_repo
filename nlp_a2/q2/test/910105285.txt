I work for a design company and we had a terrible experience renting linens from this company. We had confirmed our order several weeks in advance, but then 10 days before our event, their team emailed saying that they didn't have the color that we had already requested and ordered. A few days later, they emailed again saying they had been able to get the color from another vendor. Then, the night before the scheduled delivery, they emailed saying they didn't have the right color after all and were going to send a different color. This caused a last minute panic as we had confirmed all design details with the client. Then, the day of the event, the company emailed saying some of the linens will be one color + some will be another color. Our team emailed back saying we needed them all one color so they wouldn't clash in the room. This caused continued stress. We didn't hear back from anyone so our team called to follow up. Then finally, you confirmed that we would have all one color. However, when the linens arrived, several of the them were in the wrong sizes and others had a ton of damaged linens with dark marks on them. 

We value excellence and communication with our vendors, but when we emailed this company after the event to share what had happened, it felt like we were responded to with a challenge on how we set them up.  We are an event company that has set up numerous events and wouldn't bring an issue to a vendor unless we felt it was valid. Our client wasn't pleased with the look of the lines + our team had to navigate a lot to get confirmation on an order we put through well in advance. We have tried to get a hold of this company over the phone and over email for the past 2 months in order to be compensated for the major inconvenience, but they have ignored our emails and calls.
