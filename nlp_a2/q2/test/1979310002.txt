My hair stylist was Jina. I didn't really want to share her name because she was that great, if she gets more appointment it would be hard for me to book her next time. But still I want ppl to know that she is excellent, she fully understand what you want instead of pretending that she knows what you say. Just try and explain to her your needs and she'll share her insights :). On top of that, great service and skills.
