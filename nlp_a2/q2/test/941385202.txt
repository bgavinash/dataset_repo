Totally disappointed. Hot latte and espresso brownie. Both were sub-par. No foam whatsoever on latte. Barely lukewarm too. Brownie had no espresso taste - or even chocolate for that matter. Place is messy and unappealing. Staff is busy talking to each other instead of customers. Sorry but if you want to play with the other true coffee houses in town ie. Press, Cartel or Echo you'll have to up your game UB.
