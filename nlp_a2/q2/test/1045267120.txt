Met up with a friend here for drinks and dessert - this place is AWESOME!  Had a white gummy and some mango drink - seriously, like 8 shots of alcohol per drink, and they came out smoking from the top secret formula dry-ice/water ice pellets in the drink.  The desserts were insane - we had peanut butter and jelly donuts, banana waffles and a caramel fondue with fruits and marshmallows.  I left stuffed, a little drunk, and ready to party down the strip!  The manager and staff were super friendly and helpful, and I can't wait to go back and try more off the menu - the dinner menu looked pretty interesting as well!  A must-try when you're in town!
