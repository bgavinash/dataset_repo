She is the best doctor that I have ever had. She LISTENS TO HER PATIENTS. Which is a rarity with doctors nowadays. She is a rare gem in Gilbert. You will find no doctor better. I am a nurse and have worked for many doctors that only care about getting patients in and out in under 10-15 minutes; so trust me when I say the BEST DR. EVER.
