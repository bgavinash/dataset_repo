I had very high expectations for Blowfish BBQ based on aesthetics, because it looks amazing, but it is with some regret that I must give it a two star review. The BBQ is just not good. In fact, it was some of the worst BBQ I have ever had. After waiting for what seems like forever in the freezing cold line at the Brew Gentleman's Food Truck Roundup, I finally received my brisket slider and smoked macaroni and cheese, and boy, did they look heavenly! I squirted a healthy (ha) amount of the regular BBQ sauce onto the slider and went to gobble the meal up. The first thing that was wrong is that the bun that the slider was on was stale. Not just oh, it isn't that fresh, but stale. Yuck! I tossed the bun and dug into the meat, which was just okay. It didn't taste like much at all and was a bit gristly. I was most excited about the macaroni, so I could have forgiven Blowfish if the macaroni was amazing, but it wasn't. It was awful. The worst mac 'n cheese I have ever had. A box of Kraft instant is better. I had my boyfriend taste it to confirm/check my sanity and he could barely swallow it. The "smoky" flavor was not a nice, edible smoke, but tasted like ashes. I could taste nothing except for burnt fireplace ashes. We eat smoked food and have a smoker, so I know the difference between a nice, balanced smoky flavor and "left the food too close to the fire" taste. To end on a positive note, I did enjoy the BBQ sauce.
