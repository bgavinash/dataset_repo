Spirit Apothecary is fantastic. I just visited for the first time today. I usually frequent other stores in Lakewood as they are closer. However, I will be going here from now on. Amazing selection, just about anything you could possibly need. Prices are great, and the employees were friendly and helpful. Very welcoming environment and I can't wait to go back.
