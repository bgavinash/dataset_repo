We got to Toby Keith's @ 4:45 pm and asked for a booth. We were told that they could not seat us in a booth until 5:00 pm. So we stood there and waited for just over 15 minutes. At a few minutes after 5, we asked if we could be seated. The receptionist told us that she could not seat us because the server was not there yet. We spoke with the manager, Melissa and asked her if we could just sit in a booth with menus & water & wait for the server to show up. The manager of the restaurant said that we could not be seated in any of the vacant booths (they were all vacant) until the tardy server arrived. We said ok, and left. Pathetic customer service. We went to Flour & Barley & had great pizza.
