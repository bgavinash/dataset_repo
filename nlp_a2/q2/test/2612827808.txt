Toyota financial services is the most dishonest and ruthless company I have ever dealt with. 
My 3 yr lease ended, and I was sent an outrageous $1500 bill for excessive wear and use. 
There are two small dents or gouges near the sidewall of the front two tires, equalling to almost 1 inch. The Toyota Financial services excessive wear policy and guidelines clearly state that ANYTHING AMOUNTING TO 1 INCH OR LESS IS ACCEPTABLE.
They are charging me $400 for windshield replacement when the insurance company is deemed responsible for the chip-and lastly, they are charging me for the floormats WHEN I NEVER RECEIVED ANY TO BEGIN WITH. 
Toyota financial services are crooks. This is an unacceptable way to conduct business. This company does not care to cooperate with me or the dealership even. This company only cares to gouge honest people for all their money. They refuse to release to me the inspection report and alleged photos of damage.
The customer service this company offers is merciless-l have called back and forth for several days trying to find a resolution, only to get disconnected after being placed on hold for 45 minutes, and treated poorly and unjust.
Toyota financial services does not care to resolve this issue. Please steer clear of these criminals- they are very evil, heartless people whom no one should do business with.
