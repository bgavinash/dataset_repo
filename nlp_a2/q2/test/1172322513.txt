Every time I go here, I get awesome customer service. I love the part that you get to pile on any all the fixins that you want for no extra charge. 

The burgers are big and juicy, they also have grilled chicken breasts which are equally as good. I love that you get to pick your type of cheese, and your type of bun. I introduced both my girlfriend and my mom (a few years apart) and both have enjoyed it. 

As far as the bar is concerned, I only drink stouts and porters when it comes to beer. They have Guinness available, but only in the bottle. I haven't had any cocktails here as of yet, so I'm not able to report if they're good or not. I'll leave an updated report when I do.
