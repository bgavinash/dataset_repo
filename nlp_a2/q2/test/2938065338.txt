I LOVE Bagelino's, their bagels are authentic, chewy, taste fresh (because they are) and just overall delicious.

They also make the super trendy and very instagramable rainbow bagels which I picked up on my last visit, they will usually post on social media when they will be making them and then they ask that you pre-order and pay ahead of time. They don't have a minimum order though so if you just want one bagel that's totally cool. The rainbow bagels also come with funfetti cream cheese which is sweeter than your usual cream cheese and turn the bagel into more of a cake/dessert situation. So good! I loved the bright colours and the sweet cream cheese topped with super fun sprinkles, made me feel like a kid tucking in to lunch.

Usually when I visit I get the jalapeno bagel with plain cream cheese and pair it with soup for dipping. Soup of the day changes but it's usually pretty good, my ultimate favourite is the butter chicken soup - seriously so good!
