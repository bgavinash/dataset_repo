If anyone would like to join our law suit against Two poetic photography please email me at adrianluvsart@icloud.com we can't let these people get away with how they've treated their clients. 

Please never ever use them !!! I sadly found them for my daughters wedding this year 2-17-17 and we have yet to receive any photos and no video. We paid almost a year in advance for these photos trusting siarah and green to come thru and be trust worthy people. They blocked our number. Blocked us on instagram and refused to respond to emails. They told us lie after lie and recently they said to please be patient because they have been struggling and are being sued by others for not having the photos. But I still trusted them when they said they had ours but I know for a fact now they don't have anything so we are seeking legal action now. Please don't make the same mistake we did and go with these crooks!
