Terrible company with terrible business practices. I have spent years paying through the nose for their "Preferred" Internet tier, which is now supposed to be 50 mbps. After a technician came out to my house today he discovered that I never had more than 20-25 mbps coming into my home. So all this time I am paying a higher rate for an internet speed that I was never even receiving. After spending hours on the phone with the customer services reps (primarily morons) - the 'manager' used his aggressive customer service skills to offer me one of two options: either I get 2 months credit back or 20% discount for a year. He didn't care that his company was doing something disgustingly illegal. Why oh why do I have to live in a place where this company provides the only Internet connection. Terrible :-\
