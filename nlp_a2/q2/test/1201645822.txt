Wow! Veronica is absolutely amazing. I came to Joleon on my wedding day hoping for the best but not really knowing what to expect because I didn't do a trial. Veronica's work exceeding my expectations. I showed her two pictures of hairstyles I liked and she was able to take features from both to make my hair exactly how I pictured it. When it came to the make up, I was a little nervous because I don't typically wear much and I didn't want to look like a clown. Again, I showed her a picture a d she worked her magic. I wish she could do my hair and makeup everyday... I've never felt so glamorous!!!
