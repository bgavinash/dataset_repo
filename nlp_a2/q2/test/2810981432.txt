While this is one step ahead of Planet Fitness this place is not a place where you are going to go and get strong and built. This is a club, where you go to watch TV on your treadmill, where you can go and watch a movie in the Movie theater in the gym, where you can run into a bunch of high school kids starting crap on the basketball floor, or where you can go to watch people try and hit on women. This place is overpriced and pretty ridiculous.
