This is simply on my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Because of SushiSamba, I fell in love with sushi. I took my husband here to celebrate his 31st birthday, because he absolutely loves sushi. On top of that, he hasn't celebrated a birthday in while since he spent the last 2 of them deployed in Afghanistan. I mentioned that on our opentable reservation, and they treated us with extra care. The manager gave my husband a complimentary drink and dessert. My husband and I ordered off menu, and decided to do a tasting for $55 a person. Prices can go up depending on how much you want to spend. It was about 5 courses. My favorite was the wagyu beef empanadas, they were so delicious it practically melted in your mouth. The sashimi was delicious and soaked in some sort of yuzu sauce.

The service is top notch, and if you are looking for a unique sushi experience, you have to try sushisamba. It's an absolute must. Trust the chef, and go with a tasting, they know what they are doing there.
