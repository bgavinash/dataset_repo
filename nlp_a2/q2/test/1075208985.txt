Best flavors ever! Would eat the XLR pickle brined  chicken crisps!  Nashville hot if you can stand the heat.  A full pubs of white meat chicken, lightly battered with an awesome sauce.  The Moroccan ketchup is delish and so is the honey mustard.  Will chine back before we leave from our honeymoon! Glad we didn't wait for shake shack to open. And our waiter Bear was super nice too!
