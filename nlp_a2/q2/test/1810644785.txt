The doggie mentioned in this article went on to die of Diabetic Ketoacidosis. Her PH was 6.9 when she was diagnosed. I had to let her go. Normal PH is 7.35-7.45 in humans and dogs. I miss her terribly. Now I have rescued three doggies from the Halo Shelter. They are nice doggies and all of them have Embrace Health Insurance. 
  After I had had Banfield for a year, I wanted to stop it. So I just never went back and got other insurance on my own. They continued to charge my credit card for four months, I had no  idea,and when I tried to stop it  they said I would have to pay two more months of insurance.  I changed my credit card so they could not do that. I was in financial distress at the time. When I tried to get back on , they made me call some credit place and I was on hold for quite some time. 
   I still think that Baby died because she was put under such deep anesthesia when she was spayed when she only weighed 6 pounds. She was so smart, she was so loving, she stayed by my side all the time. 
  If you want Vet care, the shelter might give you better care. For instance, my new dog had severely stained teeth when I got him. He is old, He got hold of a bag of Trader Joes doggie chews that help with breath. Problem solved. None of these dogs are as smart as her. The poodle comes close but is not as smart as she was. Watch your Miniature Poodles, they are prone to diabetes and you might not catch it until it is too late.
