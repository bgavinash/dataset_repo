Butcher & The Brewer is the jewel of East 4th Street!

I've planned and attended multiple corporate and social events at Butcher & The Brewer. My findings are as follows : A.) The food is decadently on-point B.) The beers are spectacular (Albino Stout!!) C.) The staff is outstanding D.) It's a guaranteed good time

You really can't go wrong with this place.
