GEEEEZZZZZZZ... some of these people think they are food critics by the nit-picky tone of their reviews. 

Anyhow, I have eaten here numerous times and the food is always fantastic. I love the Las Vegas Roll, the Lemon Roll, the Shishito Peppers, the Charred Edamame, the Short Rib Ramen, the Stellar Chips... the list goes on and on. 

Also, they have a great selection of beer and wine and an awesome cocktail menu. The Water Dragon is a personal favorite. 

It is the only sushi I actually crave and the atmosphere is friendly, modern and kawaii. 

Go there!
