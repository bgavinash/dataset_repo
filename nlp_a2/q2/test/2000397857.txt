Carl and his cakes are GREAT! We ordered a cake for our recent wedding in Madison. Carl was very easy to work with, and he took great notes during our tasting (not every wedding vendor we worked with was good about doing this). We got exactly what we wanted, and many of our guests complimented us on such a beautiful and delicious cake!! Price is also very reasonable
