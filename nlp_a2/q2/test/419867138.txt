Tonight decided we'd give this fairly new place in Ahwatukee a try, have read some pretty decent reviews on the Neighborhood App....so... felt I had to write a review to let others know there is better out there.  I had the beef rolled taco's with guacamole and a bean tostada, my husband tried one of the combo plates, comes with rice and beans he had the Adovada, also has a very large tortilla that comes with it.  No drinks and took it to go, it was almost $18.00
they gave us 2 really small red hot sauces and 2 extremely hot green sauces.
Rolled taco's just alright, guacamole....Nah not good.  Tostada, the beans are a really light color but plenty of them on the corn tortilla with lettuce and small amount of cheese. Just Alright too.
I like the tostadas at Del Taco ( crunchtada's)  For Adovada, try Arriba on Chandler also try the Chilie Colorado. And The Blue Adobe Grill in Mesa is outstanding.
These other places will cost you another $4probably but you get so much more and taste too.
