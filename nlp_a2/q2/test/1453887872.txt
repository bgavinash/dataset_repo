The woman that was sitting at the front desk was rude as soon as I walked in with my daughter. She had my child wait to be taken back to be checked until she finished a very loud personal phone call on her work phone. When the results of my daughters strep throat test was ready I could hear the woman from the front desk yell her results to the doctor. I think it's worth noting that the woman at the front desk was wearing a badge that said "clinical manager". I drove to the east valley for this specific pediatric office & was very disappointed with the way they acted towards my child. Would never go back.
