The jewelry is beautiful, the problem is their lack of customer service. My husband and I have been repeat customers over the past couple of years. We also go in every 6 months to get our jewelry cleaned and inspected to keep our warranties valid.  The staff has been consistently rude and recently had "dropped the ball" (their words) when it came to updating our records of our inspections. After asking two different times during the week for proper documentation and still not receiving it, we called and asked for a manager on 12/14/17. The manager on duty that evening had an impatient tone and was unapologetic for the entire situation, blaming it on a glitch in their system but never offering to get us the documentation we were requesting. She consistently interrupted us and used phrases that someone in the customer service industry, let alone a manager, should never use.  Phrases such as, "well what is it that you want from me?", and "I'm really the nicest person in the world but you called me rude for placing you on hold" (we did not, we said that it was rude of her to abruptly put us on hold while my husband was in the middle of a sentence). As someone who works in the customer service industry I was shocked at this managers overly emotional behavior and can only hope that the whole thing was recorded so that corporate can listen for themselves. Needless to say, we will never purchase jewelry from any Jared again and will take our jewelry to get serviced at a different location.
