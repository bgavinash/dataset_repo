Horrible apartment complex. Takes forever to get any kind of maintenance taken care of. It's dog friendly and the entire complex is covered in dog shit. They have a dog park and you can't even see the fake grass because it's covered in shit. The pools look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks. The trash cans are constantly over flowing with garbage. They have assigned parking and they allow anyone to park in the spots making it inconvenient for the actual renters. Two shootings in 3 months. Can't wait for my lease to be over
