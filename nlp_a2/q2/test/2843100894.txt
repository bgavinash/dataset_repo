I came here on a Saturday for lunch. The food is descent, you can only choose from one type of shrimps, 3 fish, 2 of which don't look fresh, and calamari. 
Spices are good, service is pleasant, atmosphere is stingy, restrooms are dirty, and most annoying thing is the price, the fish is way over price. 
I am not sure I'll ever come here again. 
If anyone knows of a good Arabic SEAFOOD restaurant in the GTA please let me know.
