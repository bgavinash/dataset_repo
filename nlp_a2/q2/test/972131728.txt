I've been following this little taco shop on Instagram and couldn't believe how yummy the food looked, let alone the drinks!  My hubby and I ventured out and tried it yesterday.  We had the Mexican corn dip, cod taco, shrimp taco, and the skirt steak taco.  It was all absolutely amazing!  We will absolutely be frequent visitors!  Our waitress, Taylor, was a rockstar!
