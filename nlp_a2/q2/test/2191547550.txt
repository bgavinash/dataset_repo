I had an apt made weeks ago so I could have my eye lashes done right before I went on vacation. Got to the apt and she no-showed on me. I called the number and they tried to turn the blame on me for a wrong time - which is a lie as I had another apt at the time they said I was to be there. Also said they tried call and I didn't have voicemail - not true. I asked if she could come in and do them and they said no she was busy. I would NEVER refer them to anyone nor will I go back. I also requested a refund from Groupon and received it.
