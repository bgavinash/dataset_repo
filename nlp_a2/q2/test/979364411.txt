I made an appointment with the intent of getting cataracts reviewed, one eye in particular is like looking out a thick fog and is becoming annoying. This practice is very busy and operates like an assembly line-while the initial exam seemed thorough, you then get sent to the "closer" who makes sure you know of the upgrades available, and finally the dr. My entire appointment took over 3 hours. When I finally got to Dr Wellish, he was in such a meat market rush that I don't think he understood or cared enough to listen to what I was describing-said I had dry eyes (which seems to be the buzz word of the office as there was notices everywhere and a "survey" about the topic required)-maybe its a huge profit center. I was rushed out with copay and eyedrops paid for-and absolutely no feeling of a solution or even understanding of why I was there. Writing this review with the same hazy eye and will most likely pick up my records and go elsewhere. Big may be a big outfit but not better.
