Came here for brunch for the first time. I'll start by saying the cinnamon roll was phenomenal and you can tell it's made from scratch. Our entrees were good and service quick, however, where they fail is the so called "bottomless mimosas". They are $15 for starters, most other restaurant's are $12 aka Market Street Kitchen and The Creek Patio Grill both favorites of ours. After the 2nd mimosa, I asked for one without orange juice because the citrus was getting to me. I was informed the pour would be smaller then. 1st of all the flutes are already only filled halfway, what? And when you do not get OJ, you are looking at a shot of cheap sparking wine. WOW! Needless to say DO NOT ORDER $15 bottomless mimosas, because you are actually getting $15 BOTTOMLESS ORANGE Juice.
