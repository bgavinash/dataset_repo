Damn, what a shame.. I really had high expectations for this place. Saw all the good reviews on here and was convinced it was amazing! I'm going to give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was because its a Friday. We got 2 pizzas a lasagna, a fettuccini, and bacon wrapped scallops. Scallops were extremely oily and came in a escargot plate for some reason, confused us a little.. Pizza and pasta took longer than usual and when it finally came, pizza was okay, lasagna was too salty and the fettuccini was under cooked... Unfortunate experience.
