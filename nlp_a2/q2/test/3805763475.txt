Just opened recently, and not going anywhere.  

Food and service are on point.  Sat outside in the common area since we had great weather, so made it even better. 

- Lettuce wraps w/ Chicken - very good, nice crunch from the noodles.  
- Basil chicken - we ordered spicy, good definitely go Thai hot, but the spicy condiments gave us the extra heat we needed. 
- Lobster in green curry was also very good. Have them chop up the lobster after they bring it out, if it's too much work at the table. 
- Egg fried rice, dumplings, Pad Se Ew were also very good.  

- Our servers were phenomenal.
