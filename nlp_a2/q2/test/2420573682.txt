We ate there on March 3rd and they food and drinks were excellent! Service was pretty good. The only disappointing part was the fact they were out of one of the items on the menu. Two of us wanted the pot pie and they were out of it:( We thought it strange since we ate at 6:00! Not a good thing to be out of a limited menu item so early in the evening!
