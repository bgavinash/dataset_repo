This review is for the Birra beers specifically - each one we had was delicious! We tried the Anne, Francesco, and Ginette. The Francesco was a sweet beer that had a very nice vanilla flavour and a good mouthfeel, but was not overly heavy. The Ginette was a perfect combination of sour and hoppy. Both were fairly low on alcohol, which is helpful when you want to try different options! 

I thought their house beer was so good that I wished they had more of their own options on tap! I did not realize at the time that they were affiliated with La Succursale.

The atmosphere was nice - lots of people enjoying their Friday evening. I really liked the wood bar. We didn't try any food, so I cannot comment directly on that, but the dishes looked good based on our view of the kitchen window.
