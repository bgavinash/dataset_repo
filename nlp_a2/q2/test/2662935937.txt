I found Andrea when I bought a Living Social deal. I'm so glad I bought it! It truly was the best facial I have ever had, and I am a spa junkie.

Andrea does a massage like facial with no machines and uses all fresh organic products. When I left I felt like I had a full body massage I was so relaxed. 

I also like the fact she gives recommendations but does not push products on you.

I can't wait to go back for a fantastic facial and try other services she provides (waxing, tanning etc).
