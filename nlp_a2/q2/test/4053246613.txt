Ploy, a sweet girl, welcomed us in right away & happily took our order. The service and food were absolutely wonderful! The ticket at the end was stiff even for lunch, but it was so delicious that it was completely worth it!!! 

Â·Thai Ice Tea- too sweet, they were so nice they brought me more cream and then it was perfect!! 

Â·Massaman Curry with cilantro, onions, potatoes, and zucchini- Incredible!!! Loved it! 

Â·Shrimp Hibachi- my friend really enjoyed it!
