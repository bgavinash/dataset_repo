I called at 6pm, was told to expect a call between 7-8am the next morning.  8:45am, I call them.  The person who answers, I repeat my need and that I had been waiting for a return call. She asked " did you leave your information?" yes, yes I did.  She put me on hold, came back on the line and advised me that they could have someone out the next day! Over 48 hours from when I called, no thanks.
