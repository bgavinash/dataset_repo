Took my bike in for a tune up.. got it back and they rolled it out and handed it to me.  Went to put it on the kickstand and it almost fell over.. it was bent in a U shape!  It wound up taking them 6 MONTHS to get in a replacement part and their whole attitude in dealing with it was terrible.  Spent the entire summer without a kickstand.   I noticed one of the mechanics had the same model of bike not hard to figure out what happened.  Will never deal here again.
