Really great experience!! Honestly, my boyfriend and I tried to find something to say about it, like an actual constructive critic... can't find anything! The waiter was nice and helpful, the food was delicious. It is not cheap yet not overpriced for what you get. I would recommend it without even thinking about it! They don't have a printed menu. Everything is on boards on the walls because they're changing their menu regularly. We will definitely go back to try more food and wine!
