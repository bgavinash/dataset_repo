If I could give additional stars, I would!  The facility is very clean, well-maintained, and secure.  In comparing other storage facilities in the area, I felt the pricing at Guardian was excellent.  Most importantly, the staff has been great so far.  We worked with John and Matthew who helped to make a very stressful cross country move bearable for me and my family.  I would highly recommend Guardian to anyone in the market for a storage unit in Pittsburgh.
