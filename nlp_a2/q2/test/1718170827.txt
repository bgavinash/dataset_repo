What an Epic fail ... This property management company is truly horrible.  They come in to the area, and make it look like a prison with all the cameras they installed (cameras everywhere), then put in a "new" gate security system WHICH NEVER WORKS, even though the old system worked fine.  There is radio link connecting the back gate with the front gate (which this HOA put in) and the antennas literally stand about 25 feet in the air.  IT'S UGLY and unnecessary since both control boxes for each gate have phone modems and phone lines, which was meant so we could buzz in our guests at the gate without leaving our homes ... BUT NOT ANYMORE, CAUSE THE NEW SYSTEM NEVER WORKS!! And when this new system doesnt work they bring in this outhouse looking guard shack which is manned by someone who doesnt have a clue what they're doing. One night I counted 12 cars lined up at the main gate wait for the person in the shack to figure out how to open the gate.  Epic also got rid of the roving security patrol that the residents wanted and fought for. So now, instead of having a security guard walking the neighborhood (who could report crime happen IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD) we have cameras and a broke ass gate system, (which BTW anyone can get in by just waiting at the gate till it opens.) STUPID! 

In talking with other residents in the area, they are saying that fines are being levied for things that were settled with prior HOA companies but whoever runs this company doesn't seem to care; all they want is the money. There is also a rumor that our dues are going up ... go figure.... 

If you have any say what so ever on who manages your property STAY AWAY FORM EPIC!!! ON the other hand if you dont care who your HOA is and you are looking to buy, my place is going on the market soon, the reason ... EPIC HOA!
