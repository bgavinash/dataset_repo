I don't like giving bad reviews, but I'm so disappointed with the horrible customer service, this needs to be shared so that it doesn't happen to anyone else.

Two nights ago, I placed an order via orderit.ca to have food delivered to my condo. I chose Prego as my restaurant of choice. The menu looked great, so I was excited to receive my food. Since I placed the order at 5:57pm, I was told I would receive it from Prego (not orderit.ca since Prego uses their own drivers) no later than 6:57pm. 7:30 rolls around and I get a call from orderit.ca to let me know that my order would not be coming. 

Needless to say I was not happy. So I called Prego directly to see what happened and I was told by their Manager, "Sorry, we are very busy tonight". I told him that I placed the order before 6pm (before the dinner rush) and orderit.ca had even called to confirm with the restaurant and not only did they confirm they got the order, Prego waited 90 minutes to let me know I wasn't getting any food after I'd already paid them. 

The Manager's response: "Sorry" 

Everytime I spoke that's the only word I was greeted with: "Sorry". I couldn't believe the response so I asked to speak to the manager at which time he informed me he was the manager but he would let the chef know I was upset. Ya thanks for nothing. 

It's one thing to make a mistake, its another to miss an opportunity to fix a huge customer service error. Prego could've stepped up and tried to fix their mistake - they chose not to. 

*I have no issue with orderit.ca They were left scrambling and called and emailed to apologize the next day. Really, it's Prego to blame for poor customer service.
