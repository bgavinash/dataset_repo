Never been personally spray tanned before! Totally worth it! It gave me the base tan I needed going into the summer season. Staff is nice, as a new business they do seem short staffed so hopefully they staff up as they grow..and as always, Chardonay is always welcome!

I would recommend moving the lockers away from the main entrance so waiting guests aren't looking at you... that was a tad awkward. I was guilt of doing it to, as I waited for my spray tan.
