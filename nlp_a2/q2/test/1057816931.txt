Walk in before an 12:30 appointment nearby. Order a turkey bacon club sandwich. Wait 5 mins at the counter til the have bread ready, finally get my sandwich, and there is no turkey on it! 
Really Tims, you have the smallest menu ever, and yet you fuck up a sandwich that's name reflect all the ingredients.
