I had an appointment for 1:20pm today and came in at 1:10. I was dressed rather poorly as this was my one and only errand on my day off. I sat down at the appointment desk but I wasn't acknowledged at any point. It was at 1:40 that I finally got the nerve to see why I hadn't even been addressed yet. In the span of about 30 minutes I watched as several customers who came in after me (and better dressed than me) had their problems fixed while I continued to wait patiently. My friend who came with me (who was dressed nice) was approached about a possible appointment minutes after setting foot in the door. He said no and the employee admitted that his fellow colleagues will completely ignore customers at times. When I finally asked why I hadn't been helped the employee said they had canceled my appointment. (Why, I am not sure) He then went on to say that next time I should speak up if I didn't want the same thing to happen again. Almost as if the problem was my fault. In my opinion the issue could've been solved with some better customer service. Now I do not know why it took them so long to acknowledge me but from this review it may sound to you like I was discriminated because of the way I was dressed, but who knows for sure. I only wanted to state the facts. I seldom like to leave bad reviews or start arguments, but I felt very disrespected. And after talking about with my friend who came along, they agreed. The only reason I don't give the store a 1 star is because when I was finally helped the employee was kind and quick. My problem was solved without any payments necessary. I believe the employee's name was Orelle (?)
