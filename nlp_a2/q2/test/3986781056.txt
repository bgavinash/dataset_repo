As a guy with wavy, coarse hair that may or may not be starting to recede, just "getting a buzz cut" doesn't really do the trick anymore.  Thankfully, Melissa knows how to cut men's hair, and she does a knockout job.  

Melissa is really great at getting to know exactly what it is that you're looking for, both before and during the haircut.  She'll ask questions to confirm what it is that you want before doing anything, which is nice.  She also washes your hair and has you style it the same way you normally would before going back in and adding finishing touches that cater to you. 

I've been to other salons that cost more, but I feel like those places charge you for the experience.  Here, you get a truly personal, polished haircut on top of a great experience (beverages, warm scented towel over your face during the wash, etc.)  I refuse to go anywhere else.
