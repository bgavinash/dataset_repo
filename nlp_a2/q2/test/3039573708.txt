This place treats the patrons as if they're a product in a production line. The food is already prepared and plated (think airline food) and is brought out seconds after ordering. All the food is moved from table to table on carts, and when you order they pull a plate off the cart and serve you. They're simply trying to move as many people through as possible. We thought we'd have a nice, relaxing, long Italian meal with family and friends but after less than 45 minutes the waiter asked if we could leave because they needed the table for another party. Unreal. Half of our party wasn't even finished with their meal. For a bill in excess of $300 we should've at least been afforded the opportunity to order dessert or finish our wine. 
It's super expensive. No dish cheaper than $23...and that was for simple spaghetti. The better dishes are $35 and up. 
It's designed to push as many patrons through as they can. Unfriendly. Unwelcoming. Expensive. Not Italian. Don't go.
