I had the grilled cheese with the squash salad and a side of eggs over medium. It all sounded really simple so I wasn't expecting too much. I was pleasantly surprised! The grilled cheese was incredible and the eggs were the best I've ever had. I don't even know how you make eggs that good. They're just eggs??? I was really happy with the meal(: my hung over boyfriend and friend didn't have as great a time, but that's their fault
