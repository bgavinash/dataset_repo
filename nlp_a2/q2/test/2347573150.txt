So we start off by walking up to the counter and see what they have ..we came here to see a movie movie.
I have a big sign on the counter that says 15% off with your movie stub ..so I went over and bought our tickets first.
So we ordered our dinner chicken with spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad.
The girl says what's your ticket stub its only 10% off-is that ok ?
My response was why does the sign say 15%?
.. her reply was oh it's been wrong for a long time.
The chicken was rubbery and Chicken McNugget type of meat. Spaghetti was good but it was kind of confusing why she had to put it in the microwave for 3 minutes before she would serve it to us when it was sitting on a hot plate ...maybe not so hot !!
Well I understand why nobody has wasted their time doing reviews on this little dump .
I must have gotten the same little girl that the last reviewer got with the  snotty attitude !!- like I owed her something for her having a job
Well next time it's Fatburger they never disappoint never come to this place again.
