Ordered curbside takeout. After waiting for 20 minutes after they said our food would be done, got halfway home and discovered that they forgot a part of our order. They seemed to be understaffed. If you're going to order with them, be sure you're not starving because you'll probably have to wait extra for your food. 

Update: they refunded our order and apologized for poor service.
