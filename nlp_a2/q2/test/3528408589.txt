I've flown with Virgin America at least time times and have had nothing short of a positive experience each time.  Far and away my favorite airline.   

Here's a few of the reasons I love Virgin America, in no particular order.   I'm just crossing my fingers that with the Delta merger their quality stays. 

1.) Group Reservations.  I have booked trips from SF to DC  on VA for five consecutive years for a group of 10 students + myself.   Their group reservation folks are super responsive and really easy to work with.

2.) Price.  Each time I have flown with Virgin, they have been very competitive... at or near the least expensive, while offering a far superior quality.   

3.) Airport staff.  When flying with kids, they have always shown tremendous respect and kindness to them... treating them with dignity.   

4.) Flight crew.  Kind, professional, and responsive, without exception.   

5.) Policies.  They don't try to take advantage of you when there is a mishap.   For the first time in my life I missed a flight.   They offered me free standby on the next flight or $35 to have a guaranteed seat.  They were empathetic to my situation, not annoyed by my error.   

6.) In-flight entertainment/WiFi;    I love the music selection and making a playlist for the flight.   The WiFi is reasonably priced and reliable.   Their are 3-prong plugs that work for my laptop in coach.

7.) Leg room:  I'm 6'3" and I am comfortable in coach.  

8.) The ambiance, hipness, and their safety video... I'll leave other reviewers to offer up details about this.
