With so many healthier choices sprouting around the east valley, I will take my money elsewhere as this company serves great tasting food but horrible service. They have staff here that ''bow down'' to the most abrupt and rude regulars whom act like they need a red carpet when they arrive. I used to frequent this location here numerous times a month but was ultimately turned off by Hosts requesting me to move away from a table because a regular was coming in!! Why does Pita Jungle condone this infantile behavior? So I tried another location because I know Pita Jungle is better than this.  Nothing wrong with helping loyal customers, but allowing such behaviors causes stress for patrons like myself. I am very low maintenance, but every time I get seated I would like not to be asked to move for the measles 20 minutes I am there!  I am sure the many, staff especially feel the same way. What really drove me away from frequenting this location was how i experienced a manager miss treat their staff by berating them in front of patrons.Very disheartening.
