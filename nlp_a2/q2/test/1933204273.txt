The owner is soooo nice! I told him I found his pizza place on this app & that I was visiting from Colorado & he just seemed like my favorite uncle happy to welcome me to his home. I loaded up my GF pizza with toppings and I SERIOUSLY COULD NOT STOP EATING IT!! Soooooooo good! I asked if I could have my pizza cooked a bit longer so the crust would be crunchy and the owner's employee asked if it it was  dark enough & if I wanted it cooked longer - how nice! I had it cooked just a bit longer because I had ordered juicy pineapple (and pepperoni & onions & green peppers & ricotta cheese - I told you I made a loaded pizza!!!). I planned on only eating 1/2 and I ate all but a slice and 1/2! What a treat to eat gluten free pizza on vacation!
