I went in because there was an offer to get a $50 Visa gift card to test drive a 2018 Kona .  I loved the car and ended up wanting one .  I put in my application but they were closing and said someone would call me back .  I called multiple
times trying to reach finance or my sales guy but got shuffled around and finally got some
Info 3 days later .  They said I wouldnt qualify for the Kona but I could qualify for an Elantra or a Tucson .  They didn't have the Elantra GT I liked and said I'd need a few thousand down anyway because of my challenged credit .   I went to Earnhardt Buick in Mesa and bought a car with more options and incentives to bring the price much lower than MSRP. 

You snooze you lose Hyundai .  But thanks for the $50 gift card .... I used it at the Buick dealer as part of my $240 down payment
