I used to love this place when I flew out of McCarran, got my hometown fix of a  Italian beef. Been a year or more since I've been here, but it seems like they've changed. 
First of all Chicago dogs are served on poppy seed buns  not sesame seed buns!!!!
My companion ordered a PLAIN Chicago dog and they wanted to charge a dollar more for a pickle spear, no relish, no tomato, nothing else but a pickle on it. Its not a Chicago dog if its plain!!!. Its just a hot dog masquerading on that pathetic sesame seed bun.
 The $8.99 Italian beef is incredibly small, and I'm not sure what kind of beef is actually used, but not positive its a Vienna product.  Tables dirty, 1 worker there, incredibly understaffed for prime hours at the airport. Not to mention  I stood there for 3 minutes while my beef got cold under the ledge out of my sight ready. The one employee had 8 people in line . Dear Al, step it up,  your squandering a fantastic opportunity to serve quality Chicago food, and seriously, a $1.05 for a pickle spear when I just spent 20 bucks?  I shall be taking my Chicago food cravings to the Chicago Dog house or to Sonio's cafe  instead from now on.  I'm not complaining about prices because I know its the airport, but you used to do better.
