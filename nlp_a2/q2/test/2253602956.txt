I had the eggplant parmagiana with pasta.  I liked the eggplant but didn't care for the penne with sauce.  The sauce has nothing going for it.  My companion ordered one of his favorites, chicken marsala.  It was accompanied by less than 1/4  cup of garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  The chicken cutlets were small and thin.  Half way through his meal he asked me if we had anything in the fridge at home because he was definitely still hungry.  He said it was the first time he ate a meal at the restaurant but was still hungry.  Needless to say,  I had to go home and whip something up.
No bread was served. At an italian restaurant?????  I think that they have to rethink the size of their portions if they want to start in business.  I would have difficulty going back because I would still have to come home and cook!  
The server was excellent by the way.
