Went onlineto order a new W-Dryer w/free delivery & delivered/installed same day if order in by 3p. My order was complete b4 noon. Took them over 30 mins to call to tell when order was confirmed & merchandise has been found (though it clearly stated it was in stock). Then they said all the add'l things that were needed which were added to bill. Then I was informed there was a charge to remove the old appliances but no chg to leave in garage. I paid for an xtra $60 for everything.  I was told it would be delivered between 2-6. I was called back 40 mins later to say my name was last on list so it would be between 4-6. At 6:15 I called & got this surprise they had not already delivered. I was put on hold for 10 mins & then told my order never made it on truck. I was informed my order turned out not to be the only one that did not make it. I informed that person I was only concerned abt mine b/c  my whole evening had been lost sitting waiting for something that never was even coming. I was promised it would be delivered first between 10-11a. It's 12:10 & I called & was told I never should have been told it would get here at that time it was 10-2p. So again I'm waiting...last time I will deal w/them.
