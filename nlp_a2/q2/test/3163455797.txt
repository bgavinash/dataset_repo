More 2.5 stars. 
Really more of a Vietnamese Fusion if thats what you want to call it.  If you know and love authentic Vietnamese cuisine then this will not cut it. We had gone strictly because were meeting a celebration party and the group had decided on this restaurant. We all settled on a prefixed menu at $40 per person. Starts with Edamame with a delicious seasoning. Then it starts to go down hill. Some kind of a papaya mango salad that was too spicy and soggy! Almost everyone (11 out of 15) said the same. Next was sliced beef with stale shrimp chips! The beef was tasty but all the accompanying green salad and shrimp chips were again soggy. Then imperial rolls that were supposed to be wrapped in lettuce leafs for dipping. The lettuce, mint leaves, and cilantro had seen better days. Instead if being fresh crisp lettuce it looked like they had been sitting out and wilted. The main dishes of 2 shrimps and some pork in a pad thai was  overcooked and way too soft! 3 other couples said the same thing. The Salmon was the last on the service and that was not bad. 
The meal took so long to come out it was 3.5 hours into the night and it was 11 pm. Desert was supposed to be part of the meal but when we asked they told us the kitchen was closed! Not impressed with the meal so far everyone just went with the flow and said our fair wells!
All in all if you want a $$$"hipster Vietnamese fusion" experience and you're not fussy about eating "mushy" Pad Thai then you picked the right place! Our bill came out to $115.00 with a diet coke! Seriously this is way too much for what we got.
