Came here on a Sunday evening with a huge festival going on Dundas st. Restaurant was empty and they put the chairs on the table and said only take out. Oddly enough they weren't partaking in the huge outdoor festivities. Food tasted average but the colour of the salmon roll compared to the hae dop bop was very noticeably off colour. Don't think I would visit here again as there are many other options around.
