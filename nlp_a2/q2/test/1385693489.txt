I have to say that I am so super impressed with my recent mattress buying experience. My husband and I were really worried about buying the right mattress and not really having any knowledge about mattress shopping. Joshua was absolutely amazing and so helpful that instead of shopping around, we purchased out mattress right there and then. Let me tell you that my husband and I are so incredibly happy we made our purchase with Joshua and really appreciate how friendly and knowledgeable he was. He answered all of our questions and he thoroughly explained the 120 day policy for exchanging our mattress if we purchased one that was not right for us. As a consumer, you could not ask for better service than we received and his expertise made my husband and I feel so at ease about our buying decision. I am recommending everyone I know to go and see him. If we ever need another mattress, we know who we are going to see!
