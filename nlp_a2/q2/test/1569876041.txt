I went to Matthew Serrick in pretty good condition.  I just had one ongoing issue that needed to be resolved.  After my adjustment my back was hurt.  It was so painful that I had problems bending over and getting out of bed.  I never have had back problems before and have had successful back adjustments previously from other chiros.  When I talk to Dr. Serrick about this, he was dismissive, didn't try to resolve the problem nor take responsibility.  He's more concerned about his practice rather than his patients.  He made me feel like I was making a big deal about nothing and it was my fault for trying to bend over and pick something up even though the adjustment caused the problem..  

I had to pay more money to my RMT to get it fixed, it's been a week and half and it's still not fully better, and I missed my games in the summer due to this.  I ended up with more problems than I came in with.  I don't recommend him as a chiropractor and don't think you should feel safe with him.
