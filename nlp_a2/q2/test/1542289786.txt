Pretty standard sushi restaurant for this area, standard menu, they do an AYCE. 
Food is about average as well as price. 

They definitely cannot handle a full restaurant and our most recent experience was disappointing. Server forgot a lot of menu items for people throughout the restaurant, seemed untrained and tried to charge us for the forgotten menu items. No apologies or extra courtesy for this either. I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant over other ones in the area, probably would recommend to avoid it if they seemed busy.

 The food we did receive seemed rushed, the salad they gave us was completely drowned in dressing, which was gross. :(
