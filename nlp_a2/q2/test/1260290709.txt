I get the concept, and it has an old school atmosphere when a car isn't shinning their high beams through the front window.  The jukebox is cool to look through.  But let's be straight, this is a dive bar with non dive bar prices.  $6.50 for an old fashioned?  Heck, an Old Style in a bottle was $3, I'd hate to find out what a Spotted Cow is.
