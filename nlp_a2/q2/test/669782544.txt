My wife and I are from England. Whenever we have a craving for a taste of home we and get fish and chips from here (with the gravy and curry sauce on the side). There are usually some interesting kinds of fish on the menu, but we normally stick with the haddock which is perfectly cooked. I like it where the ends of the battered fish curl up into crunchy goodness but the fish it's self is still soft and light. 

The chips are also very well done. Soft and fluffy on the inside with a little crunch on the outside. The potatoes are cut into chips with a machine from the UK which ensures the chips are random sizes and creates scratchings (not the pork type. This may be a term from the midlands only, but I'm sure you can google it) which are a sign of a real chippy in my mind. Also they serve beer. What's not to love!
