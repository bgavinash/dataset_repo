Went to the tavern to meet friends who were listening to a band. Packed location, difficulty parking, but good vibe. 
Met friends who had table in bar area, the greeter went above and beyond, found a booth for 7 of us so we could sit together. They were great. 
Band was great. Spot was crowded. Hard to move around and hear. 
Ordered drinks and dinner. Salad for one of party was good. My BLT was ok, not as great as advertised. Overcooked bacon, mayo had a fishy flavor, meh. 
Thin fries ordered ... came out cold. Asked for a new order. Waited a little while, came out hot. Ketchup had a little kick of spice- super good. 
Problem came with the bill. Charged us not once, but twice for the fries. Ok to charge for the cold fries replaced, but twice??
Didn't realize until we left. Nothing to do because we had to leave. Maybe should have warmed fries between my hands instead of asking for new order. 
BLT was ok, Fries cold but ketchup great, overcharged, crowded but fun.  Maybe that is what is "in". I won't be back. Tarbell should do better
