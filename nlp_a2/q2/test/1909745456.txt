We came here because we wanted to go to a BYOB (o "Apportez Votre Vin") restaurant in Montreal.  After hearing about Pho Viet, we decided to go give it a try.

The place is small and gives this homey ambience, which was a plus for me.  I got a combo of grilled shrimp on skewer and grilled beef with vermicelli.  The grilled beef was delicious...cooked very nicely.  The shrimp was meh...I had a lot better tasting shrimps than that.

The dining experience was a disappointment.  First, the food took a while to come out, and then the waitress got the order wrong.  My friend order a beef with lemongrass, and she got grilled chicken instead.  When she did get the beef lemongrass, the beef had no essence of lemongrass.  She was very disappointed.  My other friend got chicken with vegetables, which she said was nothing extraordinary.

After dinner, the waitress didn't come give us the check until an hour after we finished our food.  The place was busy but not that busy to 'ignore' us for an hour.

Other than the beef and the BYO, there is nothing great about this place.  Perhaps it is their pho that I should have tried.  Oh well...
