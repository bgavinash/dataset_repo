b-e-a-UTIFUL.

Just when I thought I was "over" Vegas and not as WOWed by its decorations / ambiance of its clubs... Surrender blew me away. 

I was pretty sober because we had rushed to the club without much time to pregame, but that definitely validates the judgment of my club now doesn't it?!  

The place was GORGEOUS.  It was still like 90 degrees outside, but it wasn't too bad because there were many many pools to dip your feet in :)  I literally wanted to take picture EVERYWHERE and felt like such a tourist because I could not get enough.

Since Surrender is pretty much mostly outdoors, you don't get that "stuffy" feeling, and even if it's crowded, there's always somewhere to go.  A-Trak was playing the night we went, but we left before he came on because we wanted to see David Hasselhoff at Blush!  I wish we had stayed at Surrender, but the executive decision had already been made.

What annoyed me a little was that they made you purchase water.  At Tao, they'll give you tap water for free (obviously), but at Surrender, they didn't let us just get tap water.  This is no bueno in 80-90 degree weather, even when the sun's not out!  Marquee is like this too.  BOOOO.  Isn't that illegal?  At least it is in California.

Anyway, I want to come back here again!!
