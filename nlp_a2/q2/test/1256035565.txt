Update: I just want to verify that due to my phone experience, it put a bad taste in my mouth. My rating is very valid because it was my experience with your company. Of course, I was upset that this acupuncture facility would not honor the groupon since that is a COMPANY choice (I have worked with companies that worked with groupon). Yes, I do know Groupons terms and a stores terms, thank you for clarifying. The big rating comes from the bad experience that I received right when I first talked with someone from this company. My service was so unsatisfactory that as a customer I decided this business was not one I would go to and wanted to give a heads up to all other customers.  As a customer, we decide where we want to spend our money. We put money in your business therefore I highly believe that we should be treated with more respect especially with a sensitive subject. If the situation would have been treated better, this would have been a far better rating. 

All in all: please provide better phone etiquette training to your team cause that can make or break who and who does not come to your business.
