The food at this restaurant was a bit below average.  I ordered Vegetable Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan.  The samosas were a bit overdone...boderline burnt.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit bland with very little taste.  The naan was pretty good.  The staff provided good service.  I might give this restaurant another chance.
