Worst pharmacy staff. Told me to come back for my prescription an hour later, so I did. Prescription was ready but insurance wouldn't release it til the 24th. I wish the pharmacist would have checked that before making me drive al the way back. When I returned, the pharmacists told me they couldn't release it til the 26th. This is ridiculous customer service. This isn't pain medication or any thing that's sold on the streets. I don't understand why I was also treated like an annoyance. Do yourself a favor and don't come to this pharmacy to fill basic prescriptions.
