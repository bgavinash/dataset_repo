Pretty disappointed...the food was so so, not at all what we were expecting. The service was lacking, and the overhead music was way too loud. There were 6 I'm our party. We ordered several apps to share, which came, but we weren't given any  small plates, so we couldn't eat them. It took a few minutes to get someone's attention, not our waitress, and we were told she would bring them when they had some up. So there sat our food. 

We had the Lettuce Wraps app, & the chicken skewers were cold, dry, burned, & flavorless. We told our waitress, Veronica B. She offered to take those & bring more, which she did, but they were still dry & cold. I can only assume that the food is not made fresh to order. We didn't eat them & they were still there when she cleared our plates, but she never asked if the second set was any better.
 The chilli bowl was pretty good, but also room temperature. We were looking forward to this place, but just ended up disappointed. Don't waste your time.
