The reason why i gave tj buffet sushi & Grill 2 stars ws because when we went to go up to the hibachi area they had raw chicken, meat, etc they even had shrimp, and when i was going to grab some shrimp i saw a hair in the shrimp!! yuck good thing i looked twice, everything else was good, the decor was outstanding, and they actually play american music! they also had a decent crwod i say that because all the booths were taken.
