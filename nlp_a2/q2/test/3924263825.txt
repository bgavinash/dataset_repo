The salad was super mediocre. The chicken was dry and tasted like it was made 2 days ago. The beets were the only yummy thing in the salad. The French fries were yummy, but it's hard to mess up fries. The decor was tacky with fake flowers and beads separating us from the "lounge" area. The waitress was friendly, but forgot my mimosa. She appeared to be the only one waiting on the tables, so it seemed to be a bit under staffed. Overall, a mediocre experience.
