Had absolutely amazing service here! All staff was busy hustling and bustling but making jokes and wonderful suggestions!! Seriously the best service I've ever had. Ronnie was the COOLEST waitress I've ever had!! Jeff was a great funny host as well!! And the food was delicious, best Bloody Mary I've had!!
