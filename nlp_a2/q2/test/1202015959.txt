Absolutely incredible, ive traveled to austin and had Franklin BBQ and little miss can easily compete. The owner scott is such an awesome guy! I went once and i got to go see the smokers! Its such a friendly environment and the food is amazing. Even in the hot arizona heat it is worth the wait. While waiting in line they often give out samples and have great variety of meats. Little miss bbq is one of the best bbq restaurants in all of Arizona!
