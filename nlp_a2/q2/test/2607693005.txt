Terrible service. They messed up my nails and overcharged me. I was quoted one price and over charged. The wait took forever and when someone finally got to me it was such a disappointment. I WILL NEVER return here. I am having to dispute the charge because they refused to return my money. They were incredibly rude about it as tho I had done something wrong when it was their mess up. If I could give no stars I would. I will post pictures to show the horrible work done.
