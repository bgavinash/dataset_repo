I don't see the need normally to review a grocery store but this one needs dire help.
I've lived in Lakewood for several years now and always tell myself I'm never going back to Marc's anytime I step in there. I normally like Marc's but the Lakewood location is godawful. 
First off the parking lot here is A NIGHTMARE! I can't tell you how many times I've almost got hit in the lot. There's several blind spots when turning out of aisles. 
The aisles in this store are very narrow, the store itself is grungy, and the only staff is either 15 or 115 so take your pick. 
They do NOT take cards except for Discover so prepare to wait behind grandma writing out a check, counting out pennies, or making a trip over to the atm. I believe this is one of the reason check out here is extremely slow. There aren't any belts to load your food on but there's a tiny counter top that can only fit about 2 gallons of milk and a bag of potatoes so you can't load any of your groceries to be rang out until the person in front of you is done. I also suggest to bring your own bags. The bags here are as thin as tissue paper.
Most of the time I've came in here was to grab 1 item and end up getting frustrated trying to find it or loose my patience in line and end up leaving. I can only compare this store to the steel yard wal-mart. If you are from this area you will understand the comparison.
I recommend NOT coming here after 4pm or around the 1st of the month. You will regret it!
