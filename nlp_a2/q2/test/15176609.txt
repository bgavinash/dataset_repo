If you like clean glasses and silverware, skip this place.  After 2 wine glasses and 4 sets of silverware, I was very uncomfortable and wanted to leave.  There were chunks of cheese on each set.  Gross!!  I don't think that I will ever go back because this is not an isolated incident.  Plus, my date's lasagne was tough.  I'm so disappointed and wish we could get our time back.
