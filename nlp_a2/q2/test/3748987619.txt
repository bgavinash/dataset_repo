PROCEED WITH CAUTION... they may be RACIST... 
I'm from the south with a strong accent... I am an African American... highly educated so I'm not ghetto or anything... 2 Masters... I am a very corporate spiritual women.... I did a review after calling and Pam saying the business is closed... I wrote the review, she called me, then asked me to change the review, after I updated the review with her verbal attack, she then responded stating her business is not closed but that she couldn't meet my demands with timing or location. She bluntly lied in the review and to me... WOW!!! Read full review below... 




I just called and this business is now closed. I also asked if she had anyone she would recommend and she said no... so whatever happened six days ago in the review must have caused her to go out of business... sad


***Update*** 
Pam just called me upset that I left her with one star because they were closed. I inform her I was sad... she responded, "She has multiple businesses and it is messing up her reputation"... wow!!! I told her, "I didn't know people attacked people for yelp reviews"... then she asked me to change it to 5 stars... now because of her aggressiveness and anger she took out on me it will remain 1 star... it was all in the delivery... I take yelp reviews very seriously when I look to where I am going to spend my hard earned money... the lady in return also stated the business is close. Six days ago a guy made a very bad review but I called anyway... now I understand why his review was accurate!!! If the business is closed.... remove the business from Yelp!!! Point, blank, period... 

No physical service was provided but the customer service was poor...
