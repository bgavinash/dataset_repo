Easily the best food in Charlotte. All of the food is fresh and flavorful and there are so many great choices on the menu I am always trying something new. The owner has a lot of passion for Cusine Malaya and his diner's experiences. If any time I am hungry an dI don't feel like cooking, this is the place you can find me!
