Smoking "in the corners" outside...what a joke.  Nobody wants to smell your shit.  They need to fix that, asap.

That said, the drinks weren't bad, but the street tacos were awful.  The carne asada must have been marinated in water, because the only flavor I got was that of a griddle that hasn't been cleaned in a long time.
