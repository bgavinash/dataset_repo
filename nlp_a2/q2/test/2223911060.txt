What a disappointment!  I had a good meal at Paramount Brampton and was looking forward to sharing the same with a group of Toronto friends.  No comparison!  I ordered the Fatoush salad and like previous comments it was overpriced for what I got, too much dressing and not authentic and literally 6 small pita bits added.  My beef kabob on top had to be cut into tiny pieces to make it chewable and the whole thing was overpriced.  There were 8 of us and the dinners arrived in series so that some of us could wait and could  eat cold food, or we could eat while the others waited.  The server was pleasant, but couldn't keep the orders straight and totally confused the bills, the kitchen was slow and disorganized and the food was less than mediocre.  Only the bill was over the top!  Definitely not up to PARAMOUNT standards!.  We will not be going back.
