Horrible, wouldn't recommend to ANYONE with half a brain. My nails looked horrible the first time, and it was $65, so I went to get them fixed for free and tipped the girl $10 all for absolutely nothing because 2 days later my entire thumb gel polish chipped right off. The girl who did my nails couldn't even hold a conversation. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
