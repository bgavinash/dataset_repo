This could possibly be the worst place I've ever eaten in my life.  I ate here with a group and this is the only time I've actually seen people spit their food in napkins. two of the appetizers tasted like *#*T, now I know why the keep the lighting so low, because if you could actually see the food you would send it back.  The side orders of cauliflower, Brocatini(or whatever it's called) were a pile of mush covered with something. The swordfish I ordered was a dried out small piece of fish. The person next to me ordered the trout and it looked and tasted like salmon fish sticks. The only good thing about my entire meal was the slices of dry bread. One of the other people at our table ordered the steak and that was even bad. No one really said anything during our meal but when we got into our Uber Cab we all opened up and unanimously agreed that this was some really bad food. Our Uber driver said that he's heard horrible things about the place lately and would never recommend it to anyone.

PS. I think I heard the waiter say "The Chef" does this, "the Chef does that" over 15 times during our meal. The Chef needs to be fired in my opinion. I've had better food at Applebee's.

The prices are outrageous. 

Time to for an episode of Restaurant Impossible to be filmed here.
