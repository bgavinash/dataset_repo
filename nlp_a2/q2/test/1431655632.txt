Truly the best service department hands down! They are always very knowledgeable and take such great care of our van! We appreciate the attention to details and not being up-sold on un-necessary repairs! The staff at Honda treat us just like family! If you ever need any repairs on your Honda call and ask for Bobby Krotonsky he is the best!
