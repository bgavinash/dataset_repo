I'm always shocked to find out there are people that have lived in Champaign for years and still are not aware of this place! The quality of meat you can purchase here is far superior than anything you'll get at a chain supermarket. Their menu of available items changes often, so it's a good idea to sign up for their MeatMail newsletter. This is my go to place for all things meat. On occasion, you can find some pretty interesting items in the meat case - pork heart, uterus, liver, etc. Pretty gnarly. They sell a lot of items that most people wouldn't consider purchasing or would just throw-away. This is a great stop for organ meats if you make your own dog food. It you're more into steak and chicken, they have that covered too. The prices are often better than the supermarket and you just can't beat the quality. 

They do have some wonky hours that are sometimes difficult to shop around, but they do allow you to call in an order and pick it up so you don't have to waste time in line. If you haven't been here, you must try it. It's hands-down the best meat deli in C-U.
