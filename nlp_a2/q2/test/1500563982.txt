Rescue One seems like a reasonable company to do business with... if you're okay with them skipping appointments for no apparent reason and not bothering to give a courtesy call to inform you.
I bought a one year contract last Spring for routine check-ups on my air conditioner and heating unit.  The first appointment went okay, the tech convinced me that I needed a replacement component for my air conditioner, so I followed his advice and bought it.  
Recently I was contacted to schedule my Fall inspection of the heating unit in my home.  A date and time frame ( 3 hour window ) was confirmed.  Today was the day that was confirmed, and a phone call to Rescue One showed me on the books as having an appointment, however, no technician came in the window they said they would, and no courtesy call was made to me. A simple courtesy call would have made a big difference, but when a company does not respect my time better, they don't earn my business.
Hopefully, others have a better experience.
