First time in Arizona, and Yoli's received a high recommendation. Boy did it come through!

We went there on our first day in town, and loved it so much we went back three times!

Ordered the Veggie Omelette with home fries and corn tortillas. The veggies are grilled to perfection and stuffed inside a huge pocket of fresh eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly each time, and I'm a stickler for over-cooked(burnt) eggs in omelettes. The avocado on top was the perfect west-coast addition for me. 

Home fries were grilled perfect and not burnt. 

And to top it all, take a fork full of omelette and home fries and pile it into a fresh corn tortilla. I'm drooling thinking about it. 

Plus, when you come from freezing cold winters in Ohio, eating a casual breakfast outside is just what the doctor orders to cure the winter blues.

We came during the weekday, so we were not in a rush for anything. Since the place is small, I could see it getting pretty packed on the weekends. well worth the wait!

I will be visiting Arizona again next month, and can't wait to make it back to Yolis!!!!!!!
