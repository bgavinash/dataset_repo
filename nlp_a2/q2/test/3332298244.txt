Amazing food and not just the pizza!
We got the meatballs which were delish and the olive oil that we dipped our bread into was very sweet. The pizzas are perfectly per portioned and the crust perfectly cooked. 

The owner was the one that served us and told us that the names of the pizzas have a story behind them which was fun to hear some of them. 

It's an eclectic restaurant with church pews for some seating and unmatched chairs and tables which I loved. We sat outside because the weather is great this time of year. 

What we ordered:
Meatballs- juicy and tender and hot!
The "Adrianna" pizza  because my fiance's nieces name is that and the "Gia" which was amazing.

PROS: everything
CONS: nothing

We have found our go to spot now :)
