Well after hopping two flights from Kansas City to Nashville then here to Charlotte, NC I was a bit hungry. 

Looked at the reviews, then the menu and stopped after seeing "redneck egg rolls". The place is warm and cozy, didn't realize it was a chain until we looked it up. 

The brisket was a little dry, the pulled pork was a little dry, the ribs were fall off the bone smokey and the wings were tender and juicy. 

Here's my issue, we are in NC and yet there isn't a single bottle of vinegar or vinegar based red pepper sauce in sight. 

To the Laymen, this place could be great; to the experienced traveler, there are better stops.
