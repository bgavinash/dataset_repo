Crooks!  they are rude!  Don't know how to treat people!  One shot deal here, since they required payment first, which we comply.  They said delivery will be 2 to 3 weeks, its now over one month and my sign is not up!  Call to check, they always say they are working on it...really!  Yah, they have a lower quote than others, but expect to be delayed with your projects.
