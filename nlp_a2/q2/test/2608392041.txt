First let me start by saying I live in Columbia SC. I used to travel to go to Living Kitchen back when it was Luna's Living Kitchen. I LOVED Luna's! The atmosphere and the service was great! The food was absolutely amazing and really creative. I haven't had the opportunity to try the food since they switched over to Living Kitchen but I had a friend coming down from Charlotte that bought me some food. 
I was completely dissatisfied. I order the Living Burrito with a Broccoli Waldorf salad and the Sweet Potato Sushi. The burrito did not come with the hot sauce, no pico de gallo, no sunflower refried beans or srpouts and old guacamole. I basically got two giant collard leaves with cauliflower rice. It had absolutely no flavor at all. The broccoli salad had no flavor at all. It didn't even taste like broccoli or cashew mayo! I only tasted the raisins! The sushi was okay but I've had better in the past. The nori just seemed to be chewy and maybe that was due to the ride and the sauce was a tad bit too spicy but I'm not complaining about that. Overall, I really loved Luna's Living Kitchen but I will never eat here again. I felt it was a complete waste of money. And they got rid of the Turtle Cake which really got to me! That was my FAVORITE! I would order at least three and some to go on my trips! I would say I'd be back for some smoothies and juices but honestly at this point I'm afraid to try anything and it be a complete waste of money and time.
