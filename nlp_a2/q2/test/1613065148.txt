I don't think I'm coming back. My burger was just as bad as the one I had at the zoo. After the first bite I wished I had gone to In n Out or Burger King for that matter. The Habit adds no flavor to their char-burgers. The french fries were soggy and awful too. I don't understand these 5 star reviews. If the managers and staff are very friendly, it's only to make up for the bland tasting food.
