Always wanted to try this place and finally I did. Such an amazing place, great location, and awesome vibes. Our server was Joshua and he sure did take care of us. I never had a server who was as knowledgeable with not only the menu but the area and had great conversation. I always want to eat somewhere who specializes in appetizers and these are some of the best I've had . I will definitely return with more friends. And stop by on Thursday's for the live music.
