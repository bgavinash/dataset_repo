Saw a car that I wanted to look at online for a decent price so on my day off I make a 40 minute drive out to look at it. Once I got there the staff ignored me until I started wandering the lot looking for what I saw online. The first person who approached me was clueless about what was on the lot and I found the car before they did, only it had a not for sale sticker on it. The employee who was with me then wandered off and I was left standing buy the car with no clue what was going on so I started my way back so I could leave after wasting my time and gas driving down there. Before I could get back to my car to head back home a salesman started asking questions and trying to sell me a car that was quite clearly marked not for sale. He was actually knocking on my window as I put my car into gear to drive back home. Avoid this place at all costs.
