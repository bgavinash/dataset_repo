Front office staff is so rude, after their scheduling mistake, when I called to cancel the appointment- I spoke with someone who took the message, and subsequently received an email that I would be charged. I called the office again and the front desk person - Jennifer I think, told me it was my fault, they don't make mistakes like that- they had no message re: my cancellation. I know I had made a three month appointment, as I always do, they instead booked the appointment for 2 1/2 weeks. I called because I was confused why I had an appointment- I was also notified by the pharmacy where I fill my prescriptions- that it wasn't written as it usually was - so I asked Jennifer if that was why the appointment was booked, because of the error in the prescription- she proceeded to lecture me that the pharmacy had left three  messages about the prescription and wasn't I aware they didn't work on weekends?  I have witnessed rude behavior towards other patients in this office before, but never experienced it directly. Really appalling. I won't return and will find another psychiatrist to prescribe meds. So unnecessary- just nasty.
