I had passed by this place a million times and was always curious.  A few weekends ago I finally gave into curiosity.  Meh!

What is about the chicken joints in this part of the city NOT being able to give you what is on the menu when you order the combo?  Or being able to clearly communicate in English why you are not getting what is being advertised?  Worst yet, they charge the full price and do not offer anything extra.  

Fries were frozen (to be expected) and the chicken was sitting under a lamp.  Tasty but very far from the best fried chicken I've had.  No biscuit/bread.

The worst part was that it was all served on a single paper plate.  The grease soaked through and I was essentially eating off of the plastic tray.

Really can't recommend this one.  I suspect it survives from teens coming here after school or maybe a lunch crowd.  If you absolutely need to settle a fried chicken craving, live nearby and only order the chicken then I suppose it OK.  Otherwise you are better off skipping this joint.
