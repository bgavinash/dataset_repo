We've been putting off coming here because my wife doesn't care much for seafood. I on the otherhand, love it. One weeknight we had just exercised at the nearby LA Fitness and wanted to try someplace different for dinner. It was a weeknight and we thought it wouldn't be too busy. We were not sorry for our decision.  
The first thing I should mention was that we went on an unusually warm spring evening. Their patio was open and I have to say that you need to check this place out. We were surrounded by sand and waterfalls.  There were several firepits and couch style seating. They really make you feel as though you're on vacation.  
I should mention that the service was very good. The food was also wonderful with enough selections from both the land and the sea to keep us both happy. The only downside was the the prices are a bit high, but the quality and atmosphere are worth it for special occasions,  like when the sun goes down.
