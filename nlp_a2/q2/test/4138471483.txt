You have to put this on your list of pubs to try when in town. 

Super nice staff!!

They had some great draft choices, which seems to be hard to find for some reason. 

What makes this place a great place is the atmosphere. Cool stuff on the walls plus some unique decorations behind the bar. 

They have a couple of pool tables and ping ping should you need to be reminded how bad you are at these things. 

The food looked real food. We only drank, but would try it next time.
