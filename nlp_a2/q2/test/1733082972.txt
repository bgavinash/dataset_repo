For a steak house inside green valley ranch hotel 
I thought this was a great outing for girls night
We sat at the bar and only had drinks
They know I dislike steakhouses 
But I had some great wine
Good local clientele prices were reasonable 
The atmosphere was alive and kicking. 
If you are a steak lover you will like it here. 
I didn't try the food but the service was great 
And then we retreated to Drop Bar
