Absolutely abusive, erroneous fraudulent bill creation, threat of mechanics lien, all post spray booth rental for 2 days. Refuses to return my property, have to do a civil standby and show text messages proving owner created an invoice, because I did not book additional time. Verbally abusive, insulted me, threatened me, and now trying to hijack my wallet with a fake bill. Never signed a contract to that effect, received an invoice for 2 days spray booth rental. Owner threatened to have me arrested for trespassing if I go to get my car. Rushed out of the spray booth, unfinished, had to waste masking paper, and gave me a hard time about needing a jump start, like asking for jumper cables is some tragedy. Steer clear of this rip off shop, the owner Jens is a cocky, abusive, thief and a criminal. He cares only about money, not customer satisfaction or customers personal property.
