Was excited to see a cafe Rio open in this location. It looked promising from the menu. My visit was yesterday mid afternoon 1/3/16 and I ordered a Salmon tostada and the presentation was nice - but the rest was disappointing. 

Salmon was stored in the metal steamer pans like their other meats. However, my dine-in order was cold cold cold salmon. Yuck!!!! If it were served a little warmer it would have been much better. I was so starving I was about to eat my arm off so I ate the salmon anyway. The prices seemed fairly reasonable and there were some healthy options. I will give this try again another day and reassess. Maybe it was just a bad day to come in here. Boo.
