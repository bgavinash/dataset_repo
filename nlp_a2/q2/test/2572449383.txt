Best place to get a haircut in Toronto, IMO. I get a cut here everytime. I've had it done by several of them, and they are all good, but my fav is Michelle. Perfect, each time I come here. (I'm a guy, btw)

Also, they do accept tips, and you SHOULD tip, if they do a good job. Cut for $15, I give $5 for tip.
