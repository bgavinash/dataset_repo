Should've checked the yelp and google reviews before coming here. Wings were ok and the service was way below average, not cool when you have to ask for refills, ranch and even a pen to sign off for my check. Not going to come back, they need better servers, rather than one shoving the wrong plate in front of you and walking away without saying a word. But hey, Monkey Pants in Tempe have some of the best wings!
