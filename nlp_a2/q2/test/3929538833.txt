I've honestly never had the food but Kaya has one of the best happy hours in Pittsburgh! 1/2 off all single serving drinks and draft beer Monday-Friday from 4:30-6:30! It can't really be beat. 

When I wrote about it on my blog: https://www.nataliezazula.com/adventure/2017/10/17/pittsburgh-happy-hours

I love Kaya's happy hour for what it offers and because it begins at 4:30! Kaya's happy hour features  1/2 off all single serving drinks and all craft draft beers. What an ideal combination. It is located right in the Strip District on the corner of Smallman and 20th.

Kaya is a Caribbean restaurant and that reflects in its cocktail list. My favorite drink is the Caipirinha. It is the national drink of Brazil with an ingredient list of leblon cachaca, demerara and lime. Confused? Me too. Cachaca is also known pinga or caninha and is Brazil's most commonly distilled alcoholic beverage and it is closest related to rum.
