This restaurant has terrible service. We ordered a 3 course meal for restaurant week and ordered our appetizer, main course, and dessert all at the beginning. Our appetizer and main course came quickly and tasted delicious. After our plates had been cleared, we waited over half an hour for our desserts to come out. The table next to us, which ordered the same thing after we had ordered, received their dessert before us. In addition, we parked in the garage and hoped to have our parking
 validated. We were told that the restaurant was out of parking validation tickets but that we could press the call button on our way out and they would let us out for free. The restaurant staff lied to us as there wasn't even a call button in the parking garage. I am very disappointed with this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. The only reason they have 2 stars is because the food was decent.
