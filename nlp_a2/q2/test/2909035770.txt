FanF'ingTastic! We order breakfast from Gandolfos on a daily basis. Their Crew breakfast sandwich is great to share or eat all yourself. I have been dipping my toes in their lunch menu and other sandwiches and would have to say their Meatball Hero Sub is by far the best meatball sub I have ever had. I am not a big fan of tomatoes and if you don't either make sure to order your Meatball Hero without them. They make a lot of things fresh and give it that homemade taste. I recommend to anyone in the nearby Tempe area to give them a shot. The faculty is pleasant and the food is simply amazing.
