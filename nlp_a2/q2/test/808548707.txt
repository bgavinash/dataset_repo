I have never really trusted auto shops as I feel they are always out to get you when your car is not working right.  

I was so impressed with Max Automotive from the beginning to end of their service.  Not only did they help with rides to and from work but they actually saved me money from their original estimate.  Not only do they do great work but they are very honest.  This is hard to come by in the auto repair world.

They also fixed my parents car for $300 less than others shops were going to fix it for.

If you have anything that needs work, i would highly recommend Max Automotive!!!
