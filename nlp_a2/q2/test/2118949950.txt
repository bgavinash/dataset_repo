We generally have major no complaints about this place, but we felt pretty ripped off this Thanksgiving. Our oven wasn't in full working order, so we opted to order a ready-made turkey to go. We called a few days ahead, explaining how we'd need to feed 7 or so people. They told us they'd have a 6kilo turkey that would be adequate for $60.  

When we picked it up on Sunday, it barely weighed 7 pounds, looking half the size that they had mentioned.. and they still had the audacity to charge us the full $60. It was highway robbery! We were lucky to have prepared a great deal of side dishes and alternative meat items.  

 Furthermore.. it was super dry, and tasted ok. Wasn't a fan of the orange zestiness to it. We won't be ordering here again. The bbq chicken is good here, but I wouldn't rank it in my top 10 in Toronto. Portuguese Churrasqueiras are a dime a dozen in this city.
