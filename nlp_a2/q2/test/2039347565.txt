**Very poor experience** at the Home Depot @ 5902 W Peoria Ave in Glendale AZ. I rented a wall paper steamer there for a 4 hr contract. When I was returning it, there was one customer in front of me, it was taking a while so I was reading the contract, since I was bored, I glanced at the total charges and noticed there was an extra (optional) charge of $2.50 for extra insurance in case the equipment was damaged. On the first page it clearly shows that a customer has to initial if they were presented with this optional charge, I was never offered this protection charge or even told about it at all. When I was rung up, I asked the guy what this charge was all about, and he said it was what I had signed up for, nothing else. I said ok fine, then went to the customer service desk to inquire more about it since I felt like I got slapped with a hidden and dishonest charge. I ended talking with manager "Laurie" there and after explaining my story to her, she said nothing, while chewing her gum, there was a long moment of silence, then I said that the $2.50 meant nothing to me, it was the hidden agenda that bothered me the most. Laurie never apologized or accepted ownership of the act and said that the person that rung me up should've mentioned it. The contract does require initials as acceptance by the customer, or that the customer opted in to get it. I told her that I would pay it regardless and that it was just customer feedback at that point. After that brief interaction with someone of empowerment I did not feel that she had the skills, will or training to handle this small escalation. A mere $2.50 is worth a loss of business to Lowes and a bad survey? That's not business sense, especially for a large corp chain. Transparency is key and honest, not trying to hit your sales numbers, in this case.
