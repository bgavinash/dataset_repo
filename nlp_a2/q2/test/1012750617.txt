Not much else open on a weekday lunch so decided to grab a sandwich from AABG.

Think of AABG as an overpriced diner.  Went for the Philly Cheesteak and first glance, I was amazed at how big it is, but then once you go through it, you realize that the bread is the majority of the girth.  The bread was really tough and chewy.  The steak part was a bit dry, but it had peppers and onions with cheese, so that helped.  Asked for some BBQ sauce to give the sandwich a bit more flavor.  The sandwich also came with some fries.

There's also burgers, salads, and even meatloaf on the menu.  Probably should've went for a burger.

Service was good.  It wasn't too busy, so waters and iced tea refilled fast and the nice old lady swung by several times to check on us.
