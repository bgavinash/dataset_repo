scenario:

-walk up to the counter
-select from either 8 sweet or 8 savory $9.99 crepes
-wait for your number to be called
-walk your crepe over to a table and enjoy, or not...

just like arwen, i LOVE crepes. my friend and i used to take late night trips to Q-Cup in Milpitas for a delectable crepe and boba. 

my most favorite crepe is a strawberry and banana crepe. i LOVE fruit and i LOVE it in a nice flat pancake! at La Creperie the fruit is either frozen or canned. whatever it is, it's not fresh and overly sweetened, you can taste the preservative...

i will say they give a generous serving of fruit, but i ended up throwing half of it away. it is not worth $10 and i have enjoyed yummier crepes at chain tapioca places?!?! come on paris hotel! i will not be going back...
