The first time you come here it's all new and exciting and very very fun to do but after the second third and fourth time I really really horrible they say they going to get new exhibits but they never do know a new exhibits think it are you have to pay extra for I really do not recommend getting the year-long membership even with the kid we try to bring our kids here all the time and they are so bored of coming here after the third and fourth time it's really not worth getting a year membership everything just keeps getting more dirty and dirty because the same old movies that you pay extra for new stuff if you're going to go make sure you get a Groupon for it the only thing that even remotely makes it work half the exhibits foreclosed and the things we wanted to do we couldn't do because they are the broken or closed understaffed make things even worse I pay all that money and you would hope they would have new things there ever
