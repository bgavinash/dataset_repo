Farm-to-fork fresh and SO tasty! I went in with a Groupon in hand and left extremely satisfied. We had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Arugula Salad and OMB Copper on draft. The pizza crust is thin, chewy and absolutely delish. Toppings are piled on heavy but thats just fine by me. I'll eat them off my plate with a fork, no problem ;)
Without a deal, the prices are a bit on the high side. You're paying for the farm-to fork quality here. 

With or without a deal, I shall return. It's that good.
