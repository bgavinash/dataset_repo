Paid $65 per ticket ahead of time and then had to wait outside in line for over an hour to get in as they "oversold" tickets. I can understand how tix were oversold as our tix were not even scanned when we went in!  Anyone could've photocopied our tix a hundred times over. (Print outs) Once we got in, it was so crowded we couldn't even move. It was so disorganized! Ended up sitting on cement floor for almost 3 hours waiting for photo op as it was pointless to try and walk around.   Will not be returning.
