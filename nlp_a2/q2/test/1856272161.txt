The kids here screw up the ice cream everytime. It's all gimmick no flavor.  I have chunks of base white ice cream with my chocolate. Gross probably all artificial flavor anyway.   And it's chewy, ice cream is not supposed to be chewy.We have tried 3 visits each time is more disappointing. No more! The ice cream is one note sweet. The chocolate is a joke.
