My girlfriend and I are huge Beatles and Cirque du soleil fans and we were really excited to see this show. We loved beatles music and we love Cirque Du soleil so of course we would enjoy this show right? wrong!

This isn't like other cirque shows (mystere, ka, corteo, kooza), this is more like a dance show to beatles music. There are very little trapeze acts, contortionists, and things that amaze you. Instead people dance and walk around, come down from bungies, and rollerblade. Nothing here is truly amazing.

I was bored when watching this and couldn't wait for it to end. 
after paying $150 for tickets we felt ripped off! We had to see another show to feel satisfied and saw the blue man group the next night (which was awesome by the way). 

If you haven't seen a cirque show you will probably like this show, but if you've seen other traditional shows you will probably be bored. It seems Cirque is just lending their name out to new dance shows (viva Elvis, Chris angel believe), so I won't see any of these shows since I heard they're basically the same. 

If you haven't seen a cirque show before I highly recommend Mystere at the treasure island. You will not be disappointed.
