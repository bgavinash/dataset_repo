Before moving to Akron from California, I spotted this bakery and decided to try out their pastries since I love dessert! My favorites were the peanut butter cookies, snickerdoodles, chocolate chip, and the brownie cookies. So the past 5-6 times I've visited Akron and a day before I leave, I make sure I get my cookie fix at West Side Bakery for the plane ride home. Well 3 years later and here I am living in Akron, it was my daughter's 2nd birthday and I ordered a chocolate cake with hazelnut frosting shaped like "Nemo". Well, the cake was superb and devoured! This is my go-to bakery for all my sweet tooth cravings!
