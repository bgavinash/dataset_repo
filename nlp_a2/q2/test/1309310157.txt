Look, once you get in, it's not that bad, except that a single drink may cost you more than any other bad experience you've ever had. But you better pray to god that when you're waiting in line, you never have to use the restroom because you'll have to talk to 20 people to get back in line. You'll also probably need written approval to be in a line because it's extremely possible that you can wait 2 hours before being told you have to go in the back of the line because some employee told a group of girls they can cut everybody when they can't. I get that security has to put up with so much BS, but when everyone's treated like a scumbag in line and they try to charge you double at the entrance than advertised, it's easy to get upset. Will never go back, there's plenty of other pool parties in Vegas where this isn't a problem.
