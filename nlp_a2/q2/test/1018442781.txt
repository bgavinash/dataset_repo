Had Blooming onion, 2 Steaks, 2 sides and a piece of Cheesecake .for $40, great price, The service was well paced and quality of the food was very good.  My wife and I were marking our 33 years,  We made a good choice in going to the Outback in Mesa, A tip of the hat to the Manager and staff, GREAT JOB!
