Today I was able to make my way over to Fern with a meat eating friend, him agreeing to try it somewhat begrudgingly. As we thought it opened at nine, we arrived about an hour early for brunch. We decided to enjoy the weather and sit and chat, and after doing so for awhile, Chef Matt came out and spoke to us. He was kind, inviting, and very gently told us they opened in an hour. Once we entered, we decided on the selection of muffins with jams and butter to start with, but were surprised to be brought out both cinnamon rolls and muffins! Chef Matt kindly treated us to the cinnamon rolls for waiting- and what a treat- those cinnamon rolls were the best part of the meal! Creamy, well spiced, and with a hint of citrus, I couldn't believe they were vegan! The muffins were excellent as well, and were followed by Patas Bravas with a great spicy sauce (add avocado, it's worth it)! Fern has quickly become my new favorite Charlotte restaurant, and my meat eating friend agreed! The staff was attentive and excited, which was just a cherry on top of the excellent meal! They even packed the muffins and extra cinnamon rolls, with extras of all the spreads! Great attention to detail. We will be back!
