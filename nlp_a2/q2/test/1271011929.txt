Recently discovered this fantastic sushi place - everything about them was excellent, right from the fact that they're open till 11 to their phenomenal customer service and quick service. Their menu really stood out and they had some great innovative items on the menu. Highly recommend the golden shrimp, mango roll and snow roll! A bit expensive for AYCE ($30) but for the quality of food, it was worth it. Two negatives - too much wastage of paper due to a weird ordering system where you rip pages off a book and hand them in. The tip gets automatically added in, even if you're not a large group.
