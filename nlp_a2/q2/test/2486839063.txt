Well Nook in Arcadia has been one of my favorite places in Phoenix but this location is on a whole other level of amazing! The attention to detail in the atmosphere is captivating! I appreciate some of the historic hotel elements incorporated into the modern dÃ©cor. It still maintains the cozy, welcoming Italian home vibe that Nook is all about- "Come to the table and let's savor an amazing meal and enjoy each others' company" kinda vibe.  The service is excellent and the food just WOWs you. Chef Nick LaRosa is a culinary genius. 

Do yourself a favor and don't skip dessert: get the Affogato. Yes, even after lunch- I assure you, you'll get more work done!
