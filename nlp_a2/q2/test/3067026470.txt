In a few words, my experience with Wooldridge Law has been nothing short of exemplary. I was afraid that being young and uninformed of what to expect would make me an easy target for being taken advantage of. Nick and his team, however, took great care of me. They are honest and trustworthy, kept me informed during the whole process, and genuinely cared about helping me. Jherna's role in my case was imperative in giving me the outcome I needed. Without her assistance, the results would have been much different. She went above and BEYOND to ensure that I was properly represented and I can't thank her enough for her ongoing support and hard work. You are amazing Jherna!! I also want to thank Nancy and Adam for their patience in regards to answering my questions, and their promptness in returning my phone calls/emails. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and I would recommend them to anyone.
