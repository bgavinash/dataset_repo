Getting your eyebrows done somewhere new for the first time can be really scary. Aside from this place being super cute, chic and clean they did an amazing job on my brows! maya is really good at what she does. I'm def going to be coming back. It's a little of a drive for me but totally worth it. My eyebrows are still thick but nicely shaped.
