Thank you to the lovely girl in Customer Service who helped me today. How refreshing. I needed to make some photos. She took the time to assist this technologically challenged grandmother work the photo kiosk. It meant a lot. My little five year old granddaughter wanted to put a picture of her grandfather in a locket. Thank you for your sweet smile and able assistance!! Bravo!!!
