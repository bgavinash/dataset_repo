Found out about this restaurant via a friend. Got super excited to try it and was very glad I did.
From other reviewers we already knew that there would be a wait, so the 6 of us went right when they opened, but still had to wait an hour for a table to be ready for us (we hung out at the timmies across the street to pass the time). The host will take your name down and call you once the table is ready (crazy busy for a Sunday night).
The server was great at explaining the menu to us as it was our first time. She gave great recommendations on which sauces went with which type of seafood the best. She did tell us not to order the sizzling plate combo (said it wasn't worth it); recommended the cajun seafood fried rice and fried shrimp basket to share.
During our visit we ordered the following, we got all the sauces mild:
Cajun Fries
Cajun Seafood Fried Rice
Shrimp - Cajun
Mussels - Lemon Pepper
Clams with Sausage - Captain's Boil 
Snow Crab - Garlic
King Crab with Corn - Captain's Boil
We had loads of fun putting on our bibs and gloves for the meal. When the food came, the server also took her time to explain to us how to open up the crab legs just in case we didn't know. Pop is 2.5 per can (so no refills). Loved the corn with the Captain's Boil sauce, and their cajun fries. The clams here were my absolute favourite seafood out of the items we ordered. Looking forward to April when crawfish comes in season! Overall, prepare your stomachs and wallets for this restaurant, but well worth the messy experience!
