Barber was out of town yet again from my usual barbershop, so I decided to come back here since I had a decent experience from my last visit.

It was a pretty busy day at the barbershop, every seat was taken but there was only 2 guys ahead of me. Wait wasn't bad, but I suggest you go sometime after 12PM since that's a busy time.

**I should have read earlier reviews about Greg. If I did I probably would've waited a bit longer for another barber since I walked in. Asked for a high fade, bald on the bottom with a hard part razored in. I thought the cut was going well until he started cutting the back. He really butchered the back of my head and took out bulk at the top of the back. Also the fade had no blend on the sides. 

I would have definitely been a lot happier with going to Hector who cut my hair last time I was here or anyone else. I probably just had the least skilled barber. 

If you're going to come here, definitely try to set up an appointment with anyone else besides Greg. Maybe third time is the charm if I ever decide to come back here.
