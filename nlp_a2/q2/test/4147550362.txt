Love love love!  This place blows paradise away.  Both kale salads are so delicious, fresh ingredients, the meat is all high quality!  The bread is fluffy.  I wish there was a location closer to our house and my office.  Highly recommend using Wildflower for catering and large parties.  We order food for 20 people and it went perfectly!  The staff was very helpful and went above and beyond.
