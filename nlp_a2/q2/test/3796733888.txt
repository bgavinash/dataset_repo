It's a club in the daytime in the pool. For any Vegas club-goer that's pretty self explanitory. It's fun. Very fun. 

PRE-PARTY INSTEAD. The drinks are ridiculously priced ($130 for a 12-beer bucket) and the pool water is surely, SURELY filled with everyone's urine. Everyone goes splash-crazy when Tiesto comes on too so enjoy the urine shower.

Also they have guys on the side of the pool who squeegee the splashed water off the sides BACK into the pool - DIRTY water too - and they do it constantly. One of these guys clipped my Achilles while doing his squeegeeing and opened up a pretty deep cut into my foot. It started bleeding like crazy and the guy walked away. I went to the info desk to get a band-aid and they pointed me to the first-aid station and no one was there. So, drunk, I just went back into the pool bleeding and no one really cared.

Other than that, everyone was drunk, lots of people and it was fun.
