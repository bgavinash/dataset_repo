I was doing a review for another dessert place and wanted to give this place the rating it deserves. Always consistent,  always good,  never had a complaint on my numerous visits. The only downfall is the lack of seating because the place is small. But hey,  that's because this place is worth coming back for hence they are always fully seated. A definite recommended dessert house in North York. We recommend the green tea matcha frosty flakes (shaved ice)  and the sweet potato crepe.
