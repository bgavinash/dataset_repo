Find this place with the cute neon sign out front. Came here before a show at the Opera House and it was such a good choice, can't wait to come back!

Drinks: 
They have an extensive beer list, with rotating specials. They also have a good variety of cocktails. I'm a wine drinker and they have a number of bottles available at great prices! ($35-$55). 

Food: 
A lot of great appetizers to share and a few mains. We had the nachos which were delicious. Can't wait to try the jalapeno poppers

Service & Ambiance: 
Amazing music, cool vibes and friendly service. Can't ask for more.
