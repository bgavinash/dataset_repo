was here for a visiting DJ on a thursday night and can state with full confidence that i will not be coming here again. the DJ was awesome - that is the only pleasant memory of the night. now let's see

1. coat check took, NO JOKE, 40 minutes.... really??
2. the ratio of guy to girl was approx 10-1. that just a bit toooo uneven
3. it's in a basement. with LOW ceilings. stuffy. 
4. it.is.small. and consequently gets really hot, really quickly, from all the dancing bodies
5. drinks are not really that much more expensive than anywhere else actually
6. bathrooms are way too small and way too disgusting

to reiterate - besides the dj, there was NOTHING else to enjoy. unless they improve on most aspects, just go somewhere else. 

p.s. the outside looks really cool though! maybe that is what they lure you in with
