BEST LUNCH DEAL IN VEGAS.  Hands down!  For $20.12 at a beautifully decorated Greek restaurant in the Cosmopolitan, you get your choice of appetizer, an entree, and a dessert.  The food is delicious but not too heavy... I left satiated and not feeling like I would explode (like I do at a lot of restaurants here... not that I'm complaining!)

My friend and I showed up around noon without reservations and were seated promptly on the terrace.  It was so beautifully decorated, you almost felt like you were in a little taverna in Greece and not on the The Strip.  The service was very attentive yet not intrusive.  For the appetizer, I had the Greek Meze Plate which had a selection of tzatziki, some sort of hummus-type spread, and a red-pepper spread with pita triangles, olives, and cheese.  Absolutely perfect in every way.  My friend had the tomato and feta salad which she enjoyed as well.  We both had the shrimp dish which was served with tomato sauce and feta with cous cous.  Loved this as well.  For dessert my friend had the fresh fruit plate (which honestly looked a little disappointing but that's just me) and I had the yogurt martini which was the smoothest greek yogurt I've ever had with a berry sauce on top.  Perfect end to the meal.

Honestly, this was one of the best meals I had on the Las Vegas strip and one of the most delicious.  I will DEFINITELY come back to eat here again... in fact I'm thinking about going there again for lunch tomorrow!  Yes, it was that awesome!
