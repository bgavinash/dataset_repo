Great experience, Paw Placement helped  me find an awesome dog.  The director did a  wonderful job communicating with me by email and phone. When I went to see the dog they spent  a long time with me to make sure  that both the dog and I were  a good  match. This being the first dog I adopted on my own  several  volunteers  at paw placement were very helpful with advice , recommendations and education.
I was given a couple of phone numbers to call for any questions. All this happened over a year ago and I was so impressed with them I decided to write this review.  It was obvious to me how dedicated these volunteers are. Thank you Paw Placement !!
