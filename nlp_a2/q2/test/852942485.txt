We absolutely love everything about living here.  Wife and I used to live in Turnberry Place in 2005-2007. When we decided to do high rise living again, we looked at EVERY high rise in town for months. Turnberry Towers was set up exactly the way we needed it.  The large property within the gates is so expansive you don't ever feel cramped. Gives the residents and our guests a total resort style feel. All of the staff are friendly and helpful. Property is always cleaned by wonderful cleaning staff. The level of security is second to none. The amenities are over the top. Our dog loves the dog park and grass all around property. Finally, the friendly residents make this place feel like home.
