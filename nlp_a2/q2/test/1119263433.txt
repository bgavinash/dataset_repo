We were extremely disappointed in our visit Wednesday morning. Our visitors selected the Bellagio based on Yelp ratings which proved to be woefully inaccurate.  We went for breakfast but had to pay the holiday brunch rate.  On our first visit we were unimpressed by surroundings and process, compared to Wynn and Caesars at similar pricing. Remarkably, counter to some reviews, the most saddening aspect was the quality of the food.  Roast beef was cold, crab legs very small not worth the effort but also markedly old, shrimp mealy, California roles chewy, even the "sides" seemed less than appealing.  Cleanliness is always challenging with the massive crowd but as a sample the ice cream machine and drink stations were a mess and the ladies room inside the buffet not up to MGM standards.  Seemed to be an abundance with people wearing name tags (managers?) floating thru but we didn't witness any positive effect.  Given the configuration of the food lines, staff had to struggle with guests to maintain the stations. Sorry, never again.
