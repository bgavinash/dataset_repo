Fixed 3 phones for me quickly. 

Two screens and one battery, guy was informative and tried his best to be nice. 

Owner builds internet tv boxes that you can watch anything on, also offers lifetime replacement program. Has several options including gaming box. 

Would come here again to get phones repaired at good price.
