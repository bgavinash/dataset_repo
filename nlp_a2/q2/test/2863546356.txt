Don't waste your time coming here. I called ahead before coming to the showroom, they said to stop by and someone would help us.  When we arrived nobody would acknowledge that we were there. There ladies in the front desk, one busy and the other two just staring at their computer. Totally avoiding eye contact, you can tell they were not busy. We browsed around and then asked if someone could help us. The girl looked pretty uninterested and went to look for someone. She came back but never told us if someone would help us. Nothing at all. Apparently no one there wants to work. They lost a customer and a big sale. NEVER AGAIN!!
