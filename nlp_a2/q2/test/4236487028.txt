I purchased the Groupon for a 70min hot stone massage, since it seemed like a good deal. Let me tell you I will NEVER go back there, even if they were giving away free massages! First off, there are no doors to the rooms, only curtains, so you hear EVERYTHING going on. The ticking clock, people walking in the door, footsteps, coughing, etc. Makes it very difficult to relax. Once the massage therapist came in the room it was all downhill from there....I requested light pressure and she came at me full force even after I told her several times that she was hurting me. She did the same motion over and over again in the same spots all over my body, so I'm sure I'll be left with bruises tomorrow. The lotion is not heated so every time it was spackled on, I would jump because it was cold. She left the room a few times and never said anything to me, leaving me just laying there. The 'quadruple hot stones' consisted of her rubbing the stones up and down my back, and then that was it. It was a horrible, horrible experience. The icing on the cake was when I went to leave, the massage therapists are all hovering over their 'clients' asking them to rate their massages buy the amount of tip you leave! I could not believe it. If it was 'good' the expected tip is $15 and it goes up from there. Save yourself the bruises, and pay a little more to go to a decent place.
