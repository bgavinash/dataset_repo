YUM!  Every bite of my burrito followed a "mmmm".  My boyfriend and I came to Toronto to visit from Boston, and having at least 3 favorite burrito spots in our city we had to check this out.  

I got chicken, my boyfriend got pork.  They were very friendly and patient.  They offered us many different choices for our burritos.  It looked like they stir fried the meat with the rice and veggies- something I've never had before.  They were so amazing and delicious, I seriously don't know what could have made this any better.
