Exquisite & Chic Mediterranean cuisine, served in a striking & sexy atmosphere! The entrance is shaped like a Pyramid, when you walk in you can smell the aromas of the open kitchen, the striking ambiance with the chandeliers, Moroccan tiles and plush decor of green drapes makes it so alluring & sumptuous.

The food is outstanding, carefully seasoned & intensely flavored, the portion size is perfect!  The service was above & beyond helpful and attentive, they went out of the way to make a birthday girlfriends weekend very memorable. 

I definitely will return for another incredible & "Unforgettable" dining experience at "Cleo"
