Tender is not what you would expect at Luxor in a good way
Luxor is not a hot bed for great spots to eat

App- Short Rib Ravioli or Beef Carpaccio or both 5 star apps

Main- Wild Game tasting menu is amazing get the chantey on the side
It's something you can't get anywhere else

Side- Yukon Mashed Potatos better then grandmas

Dessert- Bananas Foster Bread pudding 

Very nice spot
