Pizza is average. Wings are horrible,  baked and soggy. I have ordered pick up a few times. Everytime I go in to pick up there is a wait. Not because there is anyone in front of me but because there never seems to be any employees working the counter. Last Monday we walked in and waited five minutes. The lady making food did greet us but then went back to what she was doing. Our food just sitting there on the counter. Also, neither of the employees were wearing gloves while preparing food. 
I can only assume that is what made two out of three of us sick later on that evening.
Will not be returning, already gave too many chances.
