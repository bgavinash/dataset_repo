Was in Charlotte a few days & was starving around midnight with nothing else open nearby. Having grown up in northern NJ, I was kind of skeptical of the halal cart having been to Halal Guys in Manhattan several times. In my mind, no one can beat their white sauce!!! Well...then came halal cart, Charlotte of all places!! I feel like I'm betraying NYC by saying this but I'm a foodie & have to be honest...Halal Cart wins! I had their gyro, lamb & chicken combo, & the next morning before heading to the airport I NEEDED another!! Sadly, I now live in the DC area, & I'm craving one now but nothing comes close here!! Can you guys PLEASE open a cart somewhere here!!?? Amazing.
