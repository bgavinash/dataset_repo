Edit 1/2010:  

I'll leave my original review untouched, but feel that I need to add that this place, as other reviewers have noted, can't seem to turn out a consistent pizza from day to day to save their life.  We've switched over to Venezia's for our slice cravings, which not only has better prices, but a much friendlier staff.  Also, we don't have to navigate teenie-bopper hell to get to the register.

Farewell J&J's, you lost us with your ever increasing prices and inconsistent quality.

Old review:

Normally I like thick crust pizza, not New York style.  But this is probably the best thin crust pizza I've had in the valley, and I'm a pizza snob.  I have regularly stopped in for a Serious Slice since they opened, and it quickly became a favorite.  Even though I occasionally get an inconsistent piece, it's mostly 4 to 5 star quality.

However...

As great as the pizza is, they've gone ahead and raised the price for a slice for the second time in a little over a year.  It went from $3.99 to $4.50, and now to $5 for a slice and a drink.  At this point, I can no longer justify the price.  I wish the owner would allow a no drink option at a reduced price, so we'll see what happens.
