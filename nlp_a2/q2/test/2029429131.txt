Fantastic! Keith the bartender is amazing- such great service. Started with the guac which was fresh and very traditional - Had the carne & pork tacos, gorditas, tres leche and flan. Margaritas were fantastic and you can tell they were made from fresh juices.  Very authentic Mexico City traditional food :)
