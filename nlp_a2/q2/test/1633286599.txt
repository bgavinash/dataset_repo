I can not say enough good things about this place. My two year old had an absolute blast. I recommend for 2-8 years old. All kids in that age range will love it. His favorites were the trampolines, huge slides, cars, and train track. He also loved climbing around on the 3rd floor as well. 

Other perks. Staff out around the activity center to prevent children getting hurt and to help lost children find their parents. There is a gate to keep kids inside, and it's the only way out. Bathrooms are family style. They made the gym with lower areas for toddlers (harder for big kids to move around because of low ceilings) and upper areas for bigger kids so they can run and jump and leap around (all kids can go everywhere) the structure. 

Parent perks: free coffee, tea, water, 20 min chair massages. Lots of parents to chat with. An area where you can bring your laptop and work it needed. Children can be entertained for 1-3 hours easily without getting bored. Mine lasted 2 hours. Parents can walk around and threw entire play structure and can actually fit in it if needed. 

Snack bar for other purchases. Can bring your own food. Party room too. 

$10 day pass, $65 for 10 visits or $225 for annual pass. Totally worth it, we will be back to visit. As I told my hubby even for nannies who make $10 an hour they would be getting the worlds best deal! 

We're from California and seriously need something like this in our town.
