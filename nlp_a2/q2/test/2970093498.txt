What can I say about WorldMark Las Vegas... It was great!!! We stayed here for free curtesy of my friend's uncle. But even if we had payed some money, the hotel was crazy awesome. The place was big and comfy. There were two bedrooms, a wall bed, and a couch! Perfect for the seven of us that went! We enjoyed the complimentary shuttle service, even though it didn't start up earlier so we missed a couple hours of CES 2017. At night we went down to the game room for some pool and table tennis. The front desk employees were nice and welcoming. Parking was easy. They have those little bell hop carts to aid you with your luggage. Everything about our stay was splendid. I couldn't have had a better stay.
