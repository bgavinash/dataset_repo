This is the best buffet that I've ever had in my life - Vincent S. 

This buffet had everything. It's pricey, but it's definitely worth the $40 that we paid. It had Kobe beef and just about everything that we wanted to eat. The service was great. As soon as we got up to get a new plate, they quickly removed our plates. I was pleasantly surprised with everything that I tried. They even had homemade marshmallows. How do you make marshmallows? This place is insane.  They also have a substantial collection of desserts, but I don't eat dessert very much, so I'm going to withhold judgement on this. 

I'm writing this review two days after eating at this place. I am still full. I still don't really want to eat anything. Everything else that I had this weekend does not compare.

My only issue with this place is the price, but if you're in Vegas, you can easily win all that money back at the casinos.
