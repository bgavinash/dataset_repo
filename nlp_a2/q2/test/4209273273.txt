Madison area has a lot to offer in terms of food but so far my sushi experience here has been underwhelming...spoiled forever by Californian sushi as pretentious as it sounds. That is why finding a place with fresh melt-in-your-mouth yellowtail belly and inventive rolls that have proper fish to rice ratio was like a little victory to me! I'm a regular now.
