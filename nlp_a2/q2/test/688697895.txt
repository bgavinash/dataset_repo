Went with family from out of town. We sat by the windows and had a nice view of the Strip. The staff is very friendly and the menu has a lot of great items to choose from. We ordered a burger which has a great presentation, they are big. We had the Greek salad which came on large romaine leafs and looked beautiful. We had the Ahi Won-Tacos which were delicious. Don't get the tacos as a meal, the tacos are small. All in all it was a little pricy but the restaurant has a fun atmosphere and really cool decor.  I am local and it was pretty easy to park and find the restaurant.
