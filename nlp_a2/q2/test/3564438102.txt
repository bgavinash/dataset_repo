Seriously ... Such a cute tea shop!  

I had tea here with one of my friends before my plane ride back to the frozen tundra, also known as Chicago.  I was happy to find that Songbird offered LOOSELEAF TEA and not crappy bagged tea.  The woman who helped us (from Rockford, IL ... can't remember her name) was the friendliest person in Arizona as well.  And the tea was pretty darn good.  

Check ... It ... Out
