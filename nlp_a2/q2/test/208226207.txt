Top Notch, hands down, damned good food and drinks! Steak with the potatoes and asparagus, one of the best dishes I had yet to encounter. The service was beyond my expectations. Modern decor mixed with occasional pleasantries such as non abrasive check ins from time to time.

No complaints, rather just simple praise on a menu well done. There is a jalepeno cocktail on the menu that will rock your socks off, er, mouth off. Liiiii.....ttle caliente for my taste, but tasty nonetheless. Truth be told that my lips were on fire in the end even after eating my meal and bread to accompany. I did notice our waiter remembered us when we came back the next night for drinks which totally sealed the deal for another go in the future.
