Two years later, and I wouldn't go back EVER AGAIN.
Everything we ordered was wrong on our most recent trip. Service was AWFUL. We had to get our own silverware and napkins (asked several times for them and I finally gave up and got them myself). After my food finally came out, the second time, they brought half of my meal & it was still raw. We had to ask to speak to a manager THREE times. On the third time I started a timer to see how long it would take. It was almost 10 minutes before my friend just went and found her. I'll never go back***


2015:
Seriously impressed. We came in for Fathers Day as a last minute decision, and I'm very glad we did.
The service was rocky at first, but quickly turned a corner and I was very pleased.
We ordered the pancetta deviled eggs, a Bloody Mary and a draft beer to start. Everything was great. The Mary's are SPICY, so if that isn't your thing- be forewarned - I believe the spicier the better. It comes topped with a chicken wing (would have preferred bacon and olives or something else).
My husband ordered the adobo tacos with rice and I ordered the CCB with brown bag fries and sriracha ketchup. The first burger came out slightly raw. When I let the server know she was so wonderful and the manager came over and let us know how sorry he was. They sent out a new one and it was better than I expected. The sriracha ketchup had just the right amount of kick- I really liked it.
Even though we were stuffed, we saw a Lemon Meringue pass by and I couldn't help but order. I'm so glad I did. It is probably one of the best lemon meringues I've ever had.

All in all, I highly recommend this place, and I'll definitely check it out for Recess soon with my friends.
