Avoid this show even if you have comp tickets!! By far the worst show I have ever seen. 

My husband and I went to see it with a couple family members on 8/9/14 because we had comp tickets. The show started out by introducing a story, but I have no idea what happened to that story. The transitions and hodgepodge dance numbers left me confused. The most entertaining part of the show was watching the bobbing head of the man in front of me who was trying very hard not to fall asleep.

The saddest part is that there are a handful of very talented dancers and singers in the show. They should quit and audition for another show on the strip because their talents are lost in this horrible production.

Jubilee! does not know what type of show it wants to be, and if the show is to survive, there need to be some creative changes. For example, don't show the Titanic sinking and then go straight to a shot of the Statue of Liberty and patriotic dancing!! Really?! Poor transition and poor taste.
