My visit took place on Jan 03, 2015. I visited the location on Las Vegas Boulevard, adjacent to the Monte Carlo Resort. (I understand that there is another separate location at the SLS Hotel & Casino.)

So let's start with the positives:

It has a great location facing the Las Vegas Strip. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The interior is well decorated. And I feel that the pricing is very reasonable, when you consider the other eating options on The Strip. Also note that one of the features of this chain is that you can "customize" you own pizza.

But with regards to the food.... Personally I can only give "an average" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the sausage with caramelized onions, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was crispy--but the bottom (flat area) of the crust was "wet". 

Maybe this is what a traditional Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be like, and I am used to "American style" pizza (?). The European tourist seemed to enjoy their meals.
