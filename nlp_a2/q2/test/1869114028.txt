Everything about Poulet Bleu is AMAZING!  I love the ambiance of the place - from the wallpaper to the lights to the open kitchen!  I ordered the trout almondine which was exceptional and very filling. Additionally we ordered the chocolate soufflÃ©. We didn't even bother to consider another dessert option. We were not able to finish but made a great breakfast with our coffee the next day. Make sure you book far enough in advance if you want a prime dinner reservation. We had one for 5pm but honestly I didn't care as long as I was able to get in!  Can't wait to go back and try the lobster spaghetti!
