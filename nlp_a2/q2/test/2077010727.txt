Poor customer service! Was just going to ask if guest staying at the hotel or (basic) membership holder can use the fast lane. You won't believe what the staff at the entrance said. After telling us No, he actually point at the sign there with a attitude that meaning "can't you read". Why would I ask you if the sign is clear enough?! I feel so offended and just walk away and went to Cesar instead. My check in experience with front desk is unpleasant as well. He didn't even border to take the time to greet you or make you feel welcomed. High end hotel with terrible customer service. First and last time.
