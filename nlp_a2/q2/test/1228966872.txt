I absolutely love this place! First off the decor is beautiful. The service was on-point! From the hostess who seated us and had a great attitude, to the waitress, Lindsey, who was delightful and very informative about the menu. We told her we had been dying to try this place out but unfortunately had only half an hour to eat before our show started. She made sure we had some signature dishes and drinks so we could get the Cleo experience, even in such a short amount of time. The stand-outs to me were the Moussakah, Tuna Tartare & Brussel Sprouts. Dishes are small as they are mezzes but they are so delicious and extremely satisfying. The Clementina and Melon & Mezcal cocktails were HEAVENLY!! At the end of our dinner the manager came out to ask us how our experience was, which was a nice way to end our dinner. I've been to many restaurants in Vegas but this one was by far one of the most memorable. I can't wait to go back!!
