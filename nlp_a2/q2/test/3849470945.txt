I've found the perfect breakfast spot. Went on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was perfectly busy but we didn't have to wait for a table.  Had the Chipotle burrito and was pleasantly surprised how good this was. Probably the best I've had at a breakfast place. My BF had the loaded omelet.  He loved it (so did I). Food came out within 5 minutes.  The place has a great ambiance as well. I'm pretty picky about breakfast places but this place is great. We'll be back.
