This location has a nice selection of home goods at great prices.  We had finished browsing 4 other home goods stores in the same plaza with no luck, when we spotted Marshall's and decided to try one more store before completing our shopping for the day.  I'm so glad we did because we found a lot of great stuff on low or clearance prices for our home. I found a pretty faux orchid arrangement for $17, which was quite a steal.  I had just been looking at a similar one in Michael's that was nearly $200.
