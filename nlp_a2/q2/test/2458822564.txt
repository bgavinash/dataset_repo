Semi helpful almost really depressed employees. Only visited twice and both times no help from staff and ignored by the employees on the floor, who rushed to help a lady with balloons instead to avoid eye contact with me...they allow pets in the store I guess had to hear how the puppy was so cute as I walked around lost. One plus, the lady in front of me checked out upset, the cashier, young, seemed unsure why and I told her, well you guys lack customer service. She listened to my input and made sure to give me a smile on my way out..I feel this location top is the problem and the unfortunate worker bees, are just trying to make it through their shift.
