WON'T BE BACk!  I have been going here for almost a year now but this place has continuously gone down hill the past couple months.  I walked into the restaurant last night to watch the game and was verbally attacked by a waitress wearing a cross-fit shirt.  Within seconds of entering the establishment she said "I don't like your shirt!" with a smirk on her face. I was wearing a sports t-shirt supporting my team and apparently she was rooting for the other. I felt very unwelcome and should've left at that point.  But I did stay and ordered the pastrami burger which was good.  My friend's sweet potato fries were small and greasy and were more soggy than crispy. Some were almost black in color and were unappetizing.  The fries used to be a lot bigger and tasted better.  Our waitress did initially check on us but then ignored us for 15 minutes.  As I've heard the management has recently changed.  While improvements have been made they have not been service or food focused.  The huge tv on the side wall composed of 9 large TVs is a great addition, unfortunately I did not discover them until I went to the restroom just before leaving because it's hidden back in a corner.  I hope for the future customers' sake that improvements will be put into the service and food in lieu of more TVs.
