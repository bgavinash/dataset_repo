I have been going here for years but the last 2 times I went have changed my mind about ever going here again. I walk in order fresh fish and ask for them to be filleted. The guy behind the counter tells me I should pick from the already cut up pieces of fish. It looks very choppy. I tell him no thank you and he gives me a dirty look. Into minutes my fish is ready. My one catfish I picked is 15.78. Ok!!!! Two pieces of fish for almost 16 bucks. And it looks choppy  Why???? 
The two stars are for the previous years I enjoyed this market.
