I travel to Glendale on work, and found this place as a blessing. I tried pretty much everything on their menu (in Chicken and vegetarian), and liked almost all the items. My favorites are Chole Bhatura, BnB Special Dosa, Bezawada Biryani, and Samosa chat. I would have eaten each of these items at least 10 times and they never disappointed. Staff is very friendly and made me feel home. Thank you guys and keep up the good work!
