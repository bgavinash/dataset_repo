Ordered  the Matador, the Buckaroo, and sriracha crisp Brussel sprouts. 

Matador was ordered medium rare, but was completely dry and well done. 

I asked for medium for my Buckaroo, but they could only do medium well for beef. Turned out well done and dry as well.

Nothing crispy about the crisp Brussels sprouts. Overall everything was generally way over cooked and lackluster.
