Meh. Went on a Saturday night around 9:30 and was told there was a 3 hour wait for a table for 4 but they had room in the standing area!  Decided to stay for one drink, which tasted good enough but was 3/4 crushed ice.  The waitress got pretty aggressive when one friend tried to order from the bartender (since the waitress was nowhere to be seen, until she came to tell him he could only order from her).  The entire time there were maybe 3-4 empty tables that were not reserved, but that the hostess would not allow anyone to sit at.  Magically, though, as we were trying to settle the bill, the waitress informed us that a table was opening up in a few minutes if we wanted to stay... Honestly probably won't come back, the service left a sour taste that not even the sweet, sweet rum cocktails could counter.
