Rude. No customer service. I got there at 4:15 with 1 person ahead of me. They told me bluntly that at 5 they stop cutting so they  won't be able to cut my hair. I guess they refuse to work past 5. And this is a place that cuts hair in 15 minutes - it's basically a Greatclips for more money. Except Greatclips actually sweeps up all the hair clippings as opposed to this messy place.
