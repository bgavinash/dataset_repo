So, if you're staying at the Rio, don't come here.  If you choose to come here, don't order the wings or the sliders.  The meat on these sliders are completely unseasoned....like to the point of unbelievability.  The wings are the kind you buy flavored and frozen that you pop in the oven.....the kind you see dying in that case at 7/11.  I hate those.  I'm not even going to focus on how the seven tables seated after us (only two of us) were served their food before we even received drinks.  Let's just focus on this microwave cuisine that they're serving at a ridiculous price.

I'm actually sitting here waiting for the manager to come to my table so I can express these sentiments to them.  Bottom line, Vegas is full of good food.  Don't ruin your trip by coming here.
