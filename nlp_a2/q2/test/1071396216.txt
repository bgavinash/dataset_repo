I gave an extra star simply because I couldn't try enough items on the menu to make a better recommendation.

Not eating pork, I am so limited with what I can eat at this restaurant. Hmmm...I'll try soup...nope-was told by the waitress that all of the soup broth is made with chicken and pork. Dan Dan noodles-those sound good. Nope, crumbled pork. Dumplings...must have dumplings. Nope...pork based soup and pork in every dumpling. So the next question to the waitstaff-what doesn't have pork. Well, the broccoli and steamed iceberg lettuce!! YUM!!! Who doesn't like steamed iceberg lettuce for dinner!?!?! 
We were able to get the cold sesame noodles with chicken and the beef and rice. Sounds good. Well, not really. The chicken in the sesame noodles tasted very fatty and had little other flavor. The beef and rice dish was very sweet. We returned that dish to the kitchen and they were very nice about that.
Bubble tea...love bubble tea. Well, no it is all milk tea. Can you not put milk in it? No. Why? The drinks are all powder drinks. Hmm, that's not tea to me.
The crunchy tofu dish was very good, I must say!! But, a full dinner meal it does not make.
I've been here several times forgetting my experience the time before. But, I think I got this. Not going back.
I think the deal was sealed when we were leaving and noticed someone in the kitchen eating their meal over the same counter where food was being prepared. 
I don't think they'll miss me. It is always crowded. Just not my thing.
