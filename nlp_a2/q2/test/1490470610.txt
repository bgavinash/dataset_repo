This was a very bad, negative experience. The service is horrendous. I was waited on by Jewel herself and she was rude and arrogant. Not at all welcoming. I will NEVER go back.
I wasted my money.  The food did not even come out as I ordered it.  I was so off put by the lack of friendliness that I just wanted to finish up and leave. 
This place is not at all what it represents it to be. it is NOT a little neighborhood cafÃ© by any means. The food is overpriced and served in a very odd way--making it totally unappealing. The food is greasy too which was a surprise.
More than anything, though, was the uppity attitude of the owner.  Really? I would suggest a little humbleness and a smile and a "Thank you for coming in" would go a long way.
As for me, I will not give it a second chance and am grateful that I can air my opinions on yelp.
BTW: the other employee there was very friendly. Jewel herself is the problem.
