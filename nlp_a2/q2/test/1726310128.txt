Teharu is so good!  I am always satisfied with everything I get there.  The sushi is awesome and not expensive at all.  Anthony was my waiter last time and he is super helpful.  I love coming here with friends.  My favorites are the haru sushi, rainbow roll and crunch roll.  Anything you cant find on the conveyor belt they are happy to make for you.  Would definitely recommend this place.
