I didn't end up going in for a tan but I walked over on a freezing day with the intention of getting one. The woman at the desk wasn't super friendly or helpful, I haven't been to a tanning bed in a really long time so I was kind of new to it and didn't know what I should be doing etc. The prices were crazy expensive! For 1 session, which would be 6 mins for me (I'm super pale and burn easy) it was $30. I could buy a bunch of minutes which would be $120 and get me 5 sessions which is still $25 a session and this is before tax or lotions. I left and did some research and found a place in Liberty Village that charges $1.15 per minute and also has bulk minutes as well. This is WAY more reasonable.
