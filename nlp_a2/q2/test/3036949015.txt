Disclaimer... I have known Matthew, the magic behind the food since he was two. That said, folks that know me, know I am honest to a fault and very picky about my food. Not only do I know Matthew, but I also know Josh, the brains behind the marketing and graphics side of the business. Both men deserve accolades for their commitment to great food and marketing.

I was fortunate to be at The Robin Room on East Johnson when El Grito was doing their thing.  They presented three equally delicious tacos all of which were expertly prepared, easy to eat, and tasted wonderful from the first bite til the last.

The tacos were like lovely pillows, nothing fancy, just vehicles for the deliciousness that lay within. The first taco was chicken, spiced with adobo and an orange salsa. Spicy, juicy goodness.

The next taco nodded to the vegetarians, with sweet potato and roasted carrots. A little crunch from the pine nuts, as the chili sauce brought awareness to your tastebuds. All in all, down right delicious.

Last but not least was the slow roasted pork shoulder. Moist juicy shredded morsels, paired with mango salsa, pickled red onion and fresh cilantro. The cilantro screamed freshness while the pickled onions taunted the roast pork saying "stand up" and be counted. The roast pork rose to the occasion.

I have to admit to drinking two Sazerac's with my dinner. My favorite cocktail allowed the tacos to shine. Truthfully, it was a lovely meal all around.

I am following El Grito on Facebook. I suggest you do the same. Can't wait until my next El Grito culinary adventure.
