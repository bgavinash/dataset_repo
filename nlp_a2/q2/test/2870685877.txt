Service is horrible, staff are usually quite rude, the only ones who actually pay attention to you are the cooks when you walk in. I ordered from here for my break, got told it would be 15-20 minute wait, so I didn't take my break until it should have been ready. I got there and my sushi was sitting on the counter but waited 20 minutes until the rest of my order was ready. Wish I hadn't paid before I got my food because there would have been ZERO tip. My sushi was mushy and cold (it was tempura, so it should've been warm). Honestly not worth the money to get treated like crap by the employees and have such gross food. I've given this place far too many chances & this was the last one.
It's a great location, wish they would try harder to keep their customers happy though.
