From the woman who checked me in, the young lady who took my vitals, and the Physician. I was in and out within 20 minutes, waited on with respect and top quality care. 

I recommend this location oppose to the Urgent Care off 16th st and Thomas (where was treated like a robot by their Physician's Assistant and I won't ever go back). 

Thank you Banner Urgent Care Saturday night staff! 

No need for blow up hands, other than giving a high five...great experience!
