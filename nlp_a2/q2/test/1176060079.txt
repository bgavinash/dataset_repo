Went here a few weeks ago because I've heard such great things but our experience was one of the worst. We got in and ordered our food, we ate and it was decent. When we went to pay we were told that the credit card machine was down. I would not of chosen to eat here if I knew that the machine was broken, I don't know why they wouldn't of informed us of this when we walked in?? Since we didn't have any cash, we were forced to wait until the machine was fixed (about 30 minutes) when we FINALLY got the check, we got no discount or any type of sincere apology, I was appalled! I had to wait 30 minutes for something YOU should of informed me of, it was your fault and I deserved at least something to fix it. This restaurant was definitely not worth the hype to me and I will not be returning because of this experience.
