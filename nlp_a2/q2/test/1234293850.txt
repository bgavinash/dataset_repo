I love Wing Stop wings but I will NEVER go to this location again. I was so happy when this store arrived in our neighborhood, it is so much closer to us than 59th Ave and T-Bird where we have always had great food and perfect service. However our first time to this store, they messed up our to-go order 3 times! We were ordering bone in wings and every time got boneless..  Each time we did not know it was wrong until we got the food home... so back and forth! Our original order was placed at 6pm, and we finally ate dinner at 9:00!
The second time it was wrong they refunded our price and sent us home with what would turn out to be another wrong order. I called and said enough is enough and asked them to please deliver the correct order, they said they could not deliver but offered we come back in that night for the correct order and they would "Put another 24 piece family meal in the book for next time"
We tried them again last night, I ordered on-line so the cashier could not mess it up again and when I went to pick it up they did not have me in their "book" and "Angela" treated me like a conniving thief. After some arguing "Angela" told me this would be the last time they would do it, as if I was trying to get something for nothing! 
 "Hey Wing Stop, I can pay for my food but I can't afford your aggravation!"
PS-  
Last night our wings did have the bones in but were ALL drumlettes... WTF?
