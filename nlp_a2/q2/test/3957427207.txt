Tried Scrambles after reading good reviews.  Unfortunately, food was cold, bacon was under cooked, biscuits and gravy was just 'slop' and it too was cold. Eggs were OK but it is hard to mess up eggs. Drip coffee had a very off taste like the carafe had not been cleaned in weeks. 
Overall the place was clean but it seemed as if they were not ready to be open this morning. 
Another thing to note that is not very clear is that it is a walk up service restaurant.   You order, then find a table and then they bring out your cold food.
