I have been going to the Old Town Cien Agaves for years and love, love, love them.  I took a trip up to the new location on Mayo Blvd. and fell in love with this place too.  The margaritas are just as delicious as the first location and so is the food and service.  Olivia the bartender was awesome!  Great food, drink and service.
