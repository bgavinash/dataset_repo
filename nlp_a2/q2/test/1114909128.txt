Although I enjoyed my stylist while I was in her chair, I walked away very unhappy. I went in for a color and cut. Ultimately costing me $120 including tip. I was planning on getting my hair colored a dark blue purple. And was told twice that my hair was light enough to take the color without lightening it. As she started blowdrying my hair we realised it was a Burgundy color. (I do not look good with shades of red). She told me I had options because she knows it was not what I wanted. I walked away with to think about my iptions and for a couple of days really did not feel pretty. Calling them back explaining the situation the manager began making excuses as to why they will not finish. I said "I would like you guys to fix this for me and if I have to pay extra, I might have to take my business elsewhere". The managaer replied "That's up to you". 
My boyfriend has been going here for a while and we both will no longer be clients here. Not a great first experience with Shear Excellence
