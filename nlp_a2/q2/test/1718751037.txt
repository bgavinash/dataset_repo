Ridiculous. They embarrass you if you dare bring your dog inside for one second to order coffee, yell at you, make you feel stupid and tell you to use the hook outside for your dog...guess what, no hook. So, "dog friendly" but you can't actually order if you bring your (seemingly unwelcome) dog friend. Rude, out of touch staff. This place could be cool under better management. Suggest pass until they get their S figured out...
