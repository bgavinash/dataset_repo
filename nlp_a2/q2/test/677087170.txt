Excellent restaurant with a wide variety of Tapas. The experience is always better when you are a larger group. I went there with friends,  we were 6 and undecided,  so we told the waiter to choose for us,  it was the best decision ever,  we received a variety of plates that we probably wouldnt order but so tastefull.
My favorite was the Paella and the Octopuss,  we also had Salmon tartar, chorizo  and cocas (the portuguese version of a flatbread.  Definitely going back.
