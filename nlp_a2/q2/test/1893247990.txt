This is my favourite place for lunch in downtown area. Being vegetarian, the variety is pretty good. We always order the vegetarian platter for 2. The food is very tasty and the quantity is good. My favourite are the red lentils and chickpea dishes in the platter, and I also love the Injira. I have recommend the place to many friends and look forward to going back again.
